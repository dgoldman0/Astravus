The character bios, timeline, setting documents, and dialogue files all contribute to the story's world, but it's unclear if some are more authoritative than others or if everything is equally canonical.

Her grandparents (Sage, Shadow, Dorian, Selene) provide wisdom and connection. Key relationships include her friendship with Cassia (writer) and Joren (protective figure). The story traces her development from childhood through her parents' preparation for 'transcendence'—merging into a collective consciousness.

The Calista story shares elements with certain sci-fi traditions: the focus on non-human consciousness recalls works like Octavia Butler's or Ursula K. Le Guin's explorations of alien minds. The transcendence concept has affinities with ideas in Clarke or Banks. The emphasis on family and community over action or technology is less common in hard SF but fits softer, character-driven speculative fiction.
