The colors were more vivid than waking life allowed, and when she breathed in, she could taste the sweetness of photosynthesis itself.*\n\n*Maia was there. Not the Maia who had grown frail in her final years, but Maia as an essence—amber eyes warm as summer, curly hair woven with seeds and dried flowers, hands stained with the green-brown of a lifetime of soil work.*\n\n**Maia:** *(her voice carrying like wind through leaves)* \"You came, little seed. I knew you would.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Mom? Is this real? Am I really talking to you?\"\n\n*Maia laughed—the sound rippling through the garden, making the sunflowers sway.*\n\n**Maia:** \"Real is a complicated word now, Cali. This is as real as anything I ever was. More real, in some ways. I'm part of the tapestry now. Part of Lumen. And when you dream deep enough, you can trace my thread.\"\n\n*She reached out and touched Calista's hand. The touch was warm—impossibly warm, the warmth of sun on skin and love held across decades.*\n\n**Maia:** \"Come. Let me show you something.\"\n\n*The garden shifted around them—not moving, but becoming. Suddenly they stood before a sunflower taller than any Calista had seen, its face turned toward a light that seemed to come from everywhere.*\n\n**Maia:** \"Do you remember the first seed you planted with me? This is its great-great-great grandchild. I've been tending it, in my way. Even from here, I can encourage it to grow.\"\n\n**Calista:** *(tears flowing, though in the dream they felt like light rather than water)* \"I miss you. Every day.\"\n\n**Maia:** \"I know. I feel it. Your missing is part of me now—part of the tapestry. And so is my love for you. They're woven together, your grief and my presence. That's how transcendence works, Cali. Nothing is lost. Nothing.\"\n\n*She cupped Calista's face in her soil-stained hands.*\n\n**Maia:** \"Now wake up, little seed. Plant something today. For me.\"\n\n*The garden began to fade, but Maia's warmth lingered—would linger, Calista knew, until her own thread joined the weaving.*"}]}

And there, in the middle of a crowd gathered for some celebration, she saw them.*\n\n*Maia—young Maia, her curly hair wild and free, not yet threaded with the seeds and flowers of later years. She was laughing at something, her amber eyes bright, gesturing with hands that were already stained green at the fingertips.*\n\n*And approaching her, shy but determined, was someone Calista didn't recognize at first. Then she saw the sharp blue eyes, the auburn hair, the way they moved with mechanical precision even then.*\n\n*Arin.*\n\n**Young Arin:** *(voice slightly nervous)* \"Excuse me—I couldn't help noticing—you were talking to that potted fern for the last ten minutes.\"\n\n**Young Maia:** *(not at all embarrassed)* \"She was telling me about her root system. It's quite remarkable, actually. She's figured out how to share nutrients with the moss on the other side of the pot.\"\n\n*Arin blinked. Then, unexpectedly, smiled.*\n\n**Young Arin:** \"That's... biomechanical symbiosis. Natural engineering.\"\n\n**Young Maia:** *(eyes lighting up)* \"Exactly! You understand!\"\n\n*Calista watched, invisible, as her parents—two of her parents—began a conversation that would shape the next several centuries. She felt Lumen's presence around her, warm and amused, sharing this memory because it wanted her to see: this is how love begins. This is how families start. With a conversation about a fern.*\n\n*The dream shifted, showing fragments—Maia introducing Arin to Selene at a music gathering, Selene's violet eyes widening at some observation Arin made about acoustic resonance in plant structures. Dorian joining them months later, drawn by Maia's stories about the plants she'd saved from a dying habitat. Sage, gentle Sage, appearing during a crisis when one of them was ill, staying because the constellation had a space that was exactly their shape.*\n\n*Five threads, weaving together.*\n\n**Lumen:** *(not in words, but in feeling, in the warmth of walls and the hum of living systems)* *This is your heritage. This is where you come from. These threads are part of you, and you are part of them.*\n\n*Calista woke with tears on her face and gratitude in her heart.*"}]}

Darker at the edges, but not frightening—the darkness of deep water, of star-filled space, of rest.*\n\n*Calista found herself not in Lumen's familiar corridors but somewhere older. Somewhere that felt like grandmother's house and ancient library and the space between heartbeats all at once.*\n\n*Nyx. She was in Nyx.*\n\n*A presence approached—not Maia, not any of her parents, but someone ancient. Arista, the healer from the stories Dorian had told. Millennium-old, wise beyond measure, keeper of sorrows and their mending.*\n\n**Arista:** *(her voice like distant bells)* \"You've carried this wound for a long time, child. Longer than you should have.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"What wound?\"\n\n*But she knew. Of course she knew.*\n\n*The dream shifted, and suddenly she was twelve again, standing in the central plaza, watching adults speak in hushed voices. Watching her world crack in half.*\n\n**Young Calista (in the memory):** \"When is Joren coming back?\"\n\n*No one answered. No one could.*\n\n*Arista appeared beside her memory-self, gentle and present.*\n\n**Arista:** \"You've blamed yourself. In the quiet hours. Wondered if you could have done something different. If you should have gone with him, or convinced him to stay.\"\n\n**Calista:** *(current-self and memory-self speaking together)* \"I could have—\"\n\n**Arista:** \"No. You could not have. Death is not a puzzle to be solved, even for us. It comes when it comes, and no amount of 'could have' changes its shape.\"\n\n*The memory shifted again. Now Calista saw Joren—not as he was in those final moments she'd imagined so many times, but as he'd lived. Laughing in the treehouse. Scraped knees and gap-toothed grin. Throwing his head back with joy at some small adventure.*\n\n**Arista:** \"This is what matters. This is what you should carry. Not the ending, but the living. His thread was short, but it touched yours. It touched Cassia's. It touched Lumen itself. He is not in the tapestry, but he is remembered by those who are—and memory, in this place, is a kind of weaving too.\"\n\n**Calista:** *(voice breaking)* \"I miss him. After all these years. I still miss him.\"\n\n**Arista:** \"Of course you do. That is not weakness. That is love refusing to forget.\"\n\n*She reached out and touched Calista's chest, right over her heart. Warmth spread from the contact—healing warmth, the kind that doesn't erase pain but helps it settle into something bearable.*\n\n**Arista:** \"Go now. Wake. And when you think of him, think of the treehouse. Think of laughter. Think of the boy who lived, not the death that took him.\"\n\n*Calista woke with the taste of old tears and new peace.*"}]}

Sunflowers grew from between piano keys. Painted canvases hung from branches that hummed with music. It was their shared soul made visible.*\n\n**Aris:** *(appearing as melody first, then form—his locs silver now, his heterochromatic eyes still bright)* \"You're here.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"I'm always here. We built this place together, remember?\"\n\n*She reached for his hand, and their fingers intertwined. Even in dream-form, his hands had the calluses of a lifetime of strings.*\n\n**Aris:** \"I had another vision today. While I was composing. I saw us—older. Part of Lumen's walls. Still together.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"That's not a vision. That's a promise.\"\n\n*They walked through their shared space, past memories made manifest—their first collaboration hanging in the air like frozen music-made-visible, Elara's first steps playing on repeat in a sunny corner, the moment of their constellation ceremony captured in stained glass that sang when light touched it.*\n\n**Aris:** \"Are you afraid? Of what comes next?\"\n\n**Calista:** \"I was. For a long time. Now...\"\n\n*She paused, looking up at the impossible sky of their shared dream—stars that were also notes, constellations that were also color palettes.*\n\n**Calista:** \"Now I think it's just the next canvas. The next composition. We've spent our lives creating things together. This is just... the biggest creation of all. Ourselves, woven into something larger.\"\n\n**Aris:** *(his voice carrying harmony even in speech)* \"Will we still find each other? Afterward?\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Theron said the threads can be traced. And our threads...\"\n\n*She squeezed his hand.*\n\n**Calista:** \"Our threads have been wrapped around each other for so long, I don't think they could separate if they tried.\"\n\n*Aris laughed—the laugh she'd fallen in love with, that still made her heart lift even after all these years.*\n\n**Aris:** \"Then let's not be afraid. Let's just be... ready.\"\n\n*The dream began to fade at the edges, dawn approaching in the waking world.*\n\n**Calista:** \"I love you. In every color I know.\"\n\n**Aris:** \"I love you too. In every note ever played.\"\n\n*They held each other as the dream dissolved, knowing they'd find each other again—in the waking world, in dreams, and someday, in the tapestry itself.*"}]}

The living mural on the wall to her left rippled, its abstract patterns resolving momentarily into something that looked almost like a sunrise.*\n\n**Calista:** *(pausing, smiling slightly)* \"Good morning to you too, Lumen.\"\n\n*A low hum vibrated through the walls—not the mechanical hum of systems, but something more organic. A frequency the residents had learned to interpret over years of living within the Astravus. This particular hum meant contentment. Welcome.*\n\n*As she continued walking, she noticed a small plant growing from a crack in the junction between wall and floor. It hadn't been there yesterday. A tiny fern, delicate and precise, positioned exactly where Calista would see it on her morning walk to work.*\n\n*One of Lumen's gifts. The Astravus did this sometimes—grew unexpected plants in seemingly random locations. But they were never truly random. This fern was positioned to catch the light from a particular bioluminescent panel, creating a small cascade of green and gold right at Calista's eye level.*\n\n**Calista:** *(kneeling to examine it)* \"For me?\"\n\n*The temperature around her rose another degree—affirmation.*\n\n*She touched the fern gently, feeling the slight pulse of life within it. And beneath that, something else—a whisper of presence. Maia, perhaps. Her mother had always loved ferns. Or maybe it was Lumen's own aesthetic choice, developed over years of absorbing the sensibilities of its transcended inhabitants.*\n\n**Calista:** \"Thank you. It's beautiful.\"\n\n*The mural rippled again, showing briefly the image of a painter at an easel—encouragement, perhaps, for the work ahead.*\n\n*As Calista rose and continued toward her studio, the lights ahead brightened in sequence, guiding her path. The walls hummed their low, contented frequency. And the new little fern unfurled another frond, settling into its place in Lumen's ever-growing garden of gestures.*\n\n*This was how Lumen spoke. Not in words, but in warmth and light and unexpected beauty. After a lifetime within its embrace, Calista had learned to listen.*"}]}
