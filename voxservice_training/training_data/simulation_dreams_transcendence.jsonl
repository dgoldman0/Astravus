Instead of Sage's distinct warmth, she encountered undifferentiated light. The collective, vast and depthless.\n\n*Sage?* she called, but the name meant nothing here. Individual identity seemed like a language no one spoke.\n\nShe tried to pull back. Couldn't. The boundaries of herself were blurring, her thoughts mixing with thoughts that weren't hers, memories that couldn't be hers—centuries of experiences flooding through what used to be protected.\n\nPanic made it worse. Each attempt to reassert individuality just showed how arbitrary that individuality had always been. What made 'Calista' real? A body? That was far away. Memories? Those were just patterns, indistinguishable from collective patterns.\n\n*Help,* she thought, but to whom?\n\nThen—a thread. Maia's love, distinct and fierce, pulling her toward something. Not back to herself exactly, but toward the part of the collective that remembered individual love.\n\nShe woke gasping, her glow flickering wildly, grateful beyond measure for the limits of her singular body."}]}

They're taught that individual existence is the smaller state, that expansion into the collective is graduation.'\n\n'And you believe differently?'\n\nShadow's laugh was soft. 'I believe what we believe shapes what we experience. If transcendence is loss, it's loss. If it's gain, it's gain.'\n\n'That can't be how reality works.'\n\n'Why not? Your projection art creates reality from belief. Why would consciousness be different?'\n\nCalista considered. 'So if I believe transcendence will destroy me...'\n\n'Then destruction might be what you create. But also—' Shadow leaned closer, darkness gentle around bright eyes—'if you believe love continues, continuity might be what you find.'\n\n'That's terrifying.'\n\n'Only if you distrust yourself. You have good instincts, Calista. Your grief is love in another shape. Love doesn't tend to create destruction.'\n\nCalista woke uncertain whether she'd learned anything—or everything."}]}

The love Maia felt for him was alien in its particularity—different from what Calista felt for anyone, and yet achingly similar.\n\n*I was terrified when I got pregnant,* Maia's memory confided. *I didn't know if I'd be a good parent. I still don't know if I was.*\n\n'You were,' Calista said, though she wasn't speaking exactly. 'Aris turned out wonderful.'\n\n*He turned out troubled and wise and difficult. Like his father. Like me.* Maia's memory-laughter. *Parenting isn't about being good. It's about being present. Being honest about your failures.*\n\n'Is that what you want me to know?'\n\n*I want you to know I was just like you. Frightened. Hopeful. Making it up as I went.* The memory shifted, warming. *You don't have to figure anything out before I transcend. We never figure anything out. We just keep going.*"}]}

Maybe she's changed beyond recognition. Maybe, maybe, maybe.*\n\n'I need her.'\n\n*Need shapes perception. Need can blind.*\n\nCalista forced herself to calm. She tried reaching without expectation, without desperation—just opening, just listening.\n\nAnd there, faint, like a plant that had recently been transplanted: Maia's presence. Not diminished but reconfigured, settling into new soil.\n\n*I'm here,* the presence whispered. *I'm learning this new way of being. Give me time.*\n\n'I thought I'd lost you.'\n\n*You did. You will. And you'll find me again, different each time.* A feeling like a smile. *That's how it works, beloved.*\n\nCalista woke with wet eyes and a peaceful heart."}]}

Her constellation, expanded over decades she hadn't yet lived.\n\n*Are you ready?* someone asked. The collective, or her own heart—impossible to distinguish.\n\nThe vision-Calista answered: *I've been getting ready my whole life. Every time I let go of something, I practiced. Every time I released control, I learned.*\n\n*Will you miss being singular?*\n\n*I'll carry singularity into the collective. That's what all of us do.* Vision-Calista smiled. *I used to be terrified of this. Now I'm curious.*\n\nThe transition, when it came in the vision, wasn't loss but unfolding. Expansion. The boundaries of self becoming permeable, then advisory, then unnecessary.\n\nReal-Calista returned to present awareness, shaken and strangely comforted. She'd seen proof that she would someday be at peace with what she currently feared."}]}

A moment stretched to contain contemplation that would take hours awake. Or hours compressed to a moment's sensation. The threshold didn't respect linear experience.\n\nShe could tip either direction—toward full consciousness with its bright demands, or toward deep sleep where individual awareness paused entirely. But staying here felt valuable. The threshold was where insight lived, where art was born, where transcendence could be rehearsed without commitment.\n\n*Stay as long as you need,* the space seemed to say.\n\n*But not forever. Living requires choosing.* \n\nShe chose waking, eventually. But the threshold's lessons lingered—identity was less fixed than it seemed. That was frightening. That was also free."}]}
