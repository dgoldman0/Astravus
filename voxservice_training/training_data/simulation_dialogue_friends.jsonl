Afternoon light filtered through gaps in the patchwork walls as Calista and Cassia sat with their legs dangling through the entrance, watching Maia's garden spread out below them like a living painting.*\n\n**Cassia:** *(scribbling in a small notebook, ink already staining her fingers)* \"What if the Tree of Echoes isn't just creaking? What if it's actually trying to tell us something?\"\n\n**Calista:** *(sketching the tree's silhouette on a scrap of paper)* \"Like what?\"\n\n**Cassia:** \"Stories! What if it absorbed all the stories from the ancient Astravus it came from, and now it's whispering them to anyone who listens carefully enough?\"\n\n*Calista tilted her head, considering. She'd always loved how Cassia saw stories everywhere.*\n\n**Calista:** \"Maybe that's why the whispers sound different depending on when you listen. Different stories coming through.\"\n\n**Cassia:** *(eyes lighting up)* \"Exactly! Oh, I should write this down—\"\n\n*She was already scribbling furiously, narrating under her breath as she wrote.*\n\n**Cassia:** *(muttering)* \"The girl approached the ancient tree, its bark rough beneath her fingers, and listened for the voices of those who came before...\"\n\n**Calista:** *(smiling)* \"You're narrating yourself again.\"\n\n**Cassia:** *(not looking up)* \"Shh. It helps me think.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Do you think when we're old—really old, like hundreds of years—we'll still come up here?\"\n\n**Cassia:** *(finally looking up, thoughtful)* \"Maybe. Or maybe by then we'll have built an even better treehouse. With a library section. And a proper writing desk.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"And a studio for painting. With good light.\"\n\n**Cassia:** \"Obviously. We'll call it the Tree Tower. Or the Canopy Castle. Or—\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Or we could just keep calling it the treehouse.\"\n\n**Cassia:** *(grinning)* \"Fine. But I'm writing a story about the Tree Tower version anyway.\"\n\n*They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the distant whisper of the Tree of Echoes reaching them on the breeze.*\n\n**Cassia:** \"Cali? Promise we'll always be friends? Even when we're ancient and wise and probably boring?\"\n\n**Calista:** \"We'll never be boring. You'll still be narrating yourself, and I'll still be covered in paint.\"\n\n**Cassia:** \"Promise?\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Promise.\""}]}

Calista arrived with paint still visible under her fingernails; Cassia had ink stains on her palms, as always.*\n\n**Cassia:** *(embracing her friend)* \"You smell like turpentine and sunshine. Never change.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"You have three different story ideas written on your left hand. Never change yourself.\"\n\n*They settled into their usual table—the one by the window where the light was good for Calista's sketching and the ambient noise was right for Cassia's thinking.*\n\n**Cassia:** \"I finished the new collection. Finally. Three years of work, and it's... I don't know. Either the best thing I've written or complete nonsense.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Those are usually the same thing with you.\"\n\n**Cassia:** *(laughing)* \"True. How's Elara? I heard she invented something that makes sculptures respond to heartbeats.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Respond to heartbeats, mood, temperature, and apparently the phase of the nearest moon. She tried to explain the engineering to me and I just nodded and smiled.\"\n\n**Cassia:** \"She's definitely Arin's grandchild.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Completely. She calls her projects 'units.' She named a sunflower Unit Seven.\"\n\n*Cassia snorted into her drink.*\n\n**Cassia:** \"Speaking of family... I've been thinking about the treehouse lately. About Joren.\"\n\n*The mood shifted, but comfortably. They'd had this conversation many times over the decades.*\n\n**Calista:** \"Me too. The anniversary is coming up.\"\n\n**Cassia:** \"I'm writing something for it. A story about three friends and a tree that remembers. I wasn't sure if I should—if it would be painful—but it felt right.\"\n\n**Calista:** *(reaching across to squeeze her hand)* \"He would love that. He loved your stories. Remember how he'd act them out before you'd even finished writing them?\"\n\n**Cassia:** *(eyes glistening)* \"He was a terrible actor but so enthusiastic.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"The worst. And the best.\"\n\n*They sat in the comfortable silence of old friendship, decades of shared memory between them.*\n\n**Cassia:** \"We kept our promise, didn't we? Still friends. Still not boring.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Still covered in paint and ink.\"\n\n**Cassia:** \"Still narrating myself when I think no one's listening.\"\n\n**Calista:** \"I'm always listening.\"\n\n**Cassia:** *(smiling)* \"I know. That's why I love you.\""}]}

Again.\"\n\n**Aris:** \"The session ran over. Selene wanted to work through the second movement one more time, and you know how she gets when something isn't quite—\"\n\n**Calista:** \"I know how everyone gets. I know how your music gets. What I don't know is when I became something you fit in around the edges.\"\n\n*Aris set down the violin case carefully—always carefully—and moved into the room.*\n\n**Aris:** \"That's not fair, Cali. You've been in here for three days straight working on this piece. You barely looked up when I brought you breakfast.\"\n\n**Calista:** *(finally turning, brush still in hand)* \"That's different.\"\n\n**Aris:** \"How is that different?\"\n\n**Calista:** \"Because I—\"\n\n*She stopped. The paint on her brush was drying. She'd been about to say something unfair and she knew it.*\n\n**Aris:** *(voice softer now, the angry edge giving way to something tired)* \"Cali, I care deeply. You know that. But we both have our own dreams and pressures. We can't keep expecting the other to orbit around us like we're the only star in the system.\"\n\n**Calista:** *(setting down the brush, shoulders dropping)* \"I know. I know. It's just... this piece is for your concert. I wanted it to be ready. I wanted to surprise you. And then you weren't here, and I felt stupid for trying.\"\n\n*Aris crossed the room and took her paint-stained hands in his calloused ones.*\n\n**Aris:** \"You're making art for my music?\"\n\n**Calista:** \"It was supposed to be a collaboration. Visual companion to the new composition. Something we unveiled together.\"\n\n**Aris:** \"Cali...\"\n\n*He pulled her close, and she let him.*\n\n**Aris:** \"We need to find a way to do this without losing ourselves. Or each other. Maybe we set dedicated time—not just hope we overlap.\"\n\n**Calista:** *(into his shoulder)* \"Scheduled creativity sounds very unromantic.\"\n\n**Aris:** \"It sounds like two people who actually want to make this work.\"\n\n*She pulled back to look at him—at his heterochromatic eyes, one brown, one hazel-green, both full of the patience that had drawn her to him in the first place.*\n\n**Calista:** \"I'm sorry I snapped.\"\n\n**Aris:** \"I'm sorry I was late. Show me what you're working on?\"\n\n*She turned back to the canvas, and this time when she picked up the brush, he was beside her.*"}]}

It's whether you keep trying, keep learning, keep loving. Our parents messed up with us too, you know. Maia once let me plant an entire garden of something that turned out to be mildly hallucinogenic.
