Still writing everything down.'\n\n'I published that book.'\n\n'After I forced you.'\n\n'After you supported me. There's a difference.' Cassia pulled out her notebook—different from childhood ones but same purpose. 'I've been writing about Maia. About what you're going through. Is that okay?'\n\nCalista was quiet. 'Can I read it?'\n\n'When you're ready. When it's ready.'\n\n'Will it make me cry?'\n\n'Probably.'\n\n'Then yes. Someone should capture this. It might help others.' Calista looked at the sky. 'We're not children anymore.'\n\n'No. But we're still us.'"}]}

'Maybe you're more like me than you admitted.'\n\n'Tragedy.' But Cassia smiled too. 'I don't want your success, exactly. I just want my own to feel as real.'\n\n'Your writing matters. Just to different people, in different ways.'\n\n'And if I never believe that?'\n\n'Then I'll keep telling you until you do.'"}]}

'You?'\n\n'Don't look so shocked. I write about everything. I think about everything. And the more I think about transcendence, the more I hate it.'\n\n'But you've never said—'\n\n'Because everyone treats acceptance as the only healthy response. I've read your grandmother's consciousness through the Tree. I've felt her there. And I still hate that she's not actually here, cooking soup that burns, forgetting where she put her pruning shears.'\n\n'Cassia...' Calista didn't know what to say.\n\n'I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying we're different. Your art helped you process it. My writing... just makes me clearer about how angry I am.'\n\n'Are you angry at me? For accepting it?'\n\n'No. Maybe a little jealous.' Cassia smiled grimly. 'You always did feel things faster than me. I'm still catching up.'"}]}

'I don't know what to do with these feelings.'\n\n'No one does. That's the secret. We're all improvising.'\n\n'You and your partner seem so sure.'\n\n'We're good at seeming.

Then you'll decide if fixing it is worth the effort.' Lysandra touched Calista's shoulder. 'Stop overthinking. Just exist near him and see what happens.'"}]}

And I thought, if I could capture it—capture her—in a projection, I'd have her forever.'\n\n'And the pressure of that made creating impossible.'\n\n'I have to do this.'\n\n'You don't have to do anything. That's the trap.' Joren sat beside her. 'The block isn't about ability. It's about expectation. You've decided this projection needs to be the most important thing you've ever made.'\n\n'Isn't it?'\n\n'Maybe. But you can't make important art by demanding importance. You make small, honest art, and sometimes importance happens.'\n\n'So what do I do?'\n\n'Make something small. Something meaningless. A single leaf. The color of the light in your room. Don't save anyone. Don't preserve anything. Just make.'\n\nIt took two more weeks. But eventually, Calista made a leaf. And then another."}]}
