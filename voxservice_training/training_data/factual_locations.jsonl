Windows, translucent walls, and light-channeling architecture ensure residents can photosynthesize effectively at home.\n\n**Size and Privacy**: Despite abundance, residences aren't necessarily large. Astravii don't require as much 'stuff' as humans might—photosynthesis reduces food storage needs, and the collective consciousness reduces isolation that might drive space accumulation.\n\n**Family Configurations**: Residences accommodate constellations of varying sizes. Some house individual pairs, others extended family groupings. The architecture is often modular, allowing adaptation as constellation composition changes.\n\n**Personal Spaces**: Despite collective orientation, Astravii value some private space. Residences include areas for individual retreat, creative work, or private conversation.\n\n**Communal Integration**: Residences connect to community spaces readily.

Their relationship unfolds through shared activity rather than just conversation.\n\n**Transition Space**: As Maia approaches transcendence, the garden takes on additional weight. Who will tend it when she's gone? What of her remains in the plants she cared for? These questions make the garden emotionally charged.\n\n**Healing Location**: Throughout the story, characters come to the garden for grounding. Soil connects to something beyond current turmoil.
