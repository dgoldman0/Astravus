Her development arcs through distinct phases:\n\n**Childhood (0-15):** Forms foundational bonds with her five-parent constellation, develops early artistic sensibilities under Maia's gardening lessons and Selene's music instruction, and experiences formative trauma when her friend Joren dies in an accident.\n\n**Adolescence/Young Adulthood (15-35):** Navigates first love with Lysandra (which ends in mutual separation), deepens friendship with Cassia, visits Aurora and learns about transcendence from elder Theron, begins volunteering at the art center, and undergoes Core Integration at age 35.\n\n**Adulthood (35-75):** Meets and partners with Aris, experiences first mind-link, develops collaborative art-music practice, forms constellation, and becomes a parent to Elara.\n\n**Later Years (75-125+):** Mentors the next generation, watches her parents approach transcendence, supports Elara's engineering career, processes Lyra's expeditions, and begins her own transcendence through shared dreams.\n\nThroughout, she processes life's transitions through art—grief for Joren becomes a memorial mural, love for Aris manifests in collaborative pieces, and her approach to transcendence is characterized by the same contemplative creativity she brings to all experiences."}]}

High cheekbones and a narrow face give her an almost ethereal quality. She has extraordinarily long fingers—pianist's hands taken to an extreme—with calluses in distinct patterns from specific instruments. She tends to sway slightly even when standing still, as if always hearing rhythm.\n\n**Profession:** Not merely a performer but an acoustic architect—she designs the soundscapes of Lumen's spaces, understanding that how a room sounds shapes how people feel in it. She works with Arin on vibration and resonance.\n\n**Quirks:**\n- **Perfect pitch 'curse':** Hears when anything is slightly off-tune—door hinges, ventilation systems, water pipes. Sometimes stops mid-conversation to adjust something humming at the wrong frequency.\n- **Composes in sleep:** Keeps instruments by bedside because melodies come during dreams. Has composed entire pieces while half-asleep. Family is accustomed to 3am music.\n- **Synesthetic pitch-to-emotion:** Experiences specific musical notes as distinct emotions. C major feels like 'comfortable reunion,' B minor like 'dignified acceptance.' Communicates emotional states by humming notes.\n\n**Relationship with Calista:** Teaches Calista to play flute with patience and encouragement.

She admires Lyra's adventurous spirit while worrying about her safety.\n\n**The Expedition Decision:** When Lyra announces she wants to journey to other Astravii communities, Calista's trauma from Joren's death surfaces intensely. She feels 'a surge of protective worry' and initially tries to convince Lyra of the dangers. The thought of losing Lyra to a similar fate is 'almost unbearable.'\n\n**Acceptance:** Despite her fears, Calista recognizes she must support Lyra's calling. She extracts a promise: 'Promise me you'll take every precaution... And stay in constant communication.' Lyra gives firm commitment.\n\n**Adult Respect:** The younger-sister relationship transforms into mutual respect between adults. Calista learns to accept Lyra's autonomy even while managing her own fears. When Lyra returns from expeditions with stories and artifacts, the relationship is enriched by Lyra's experiences and Calista's pride in her sister's accomplishments."}]}

Her garden serves as both metaphor and practice ground for parenting—you tend, you water, you provide good conditions, but you don't force the plant to grow a particular way."}]}

Cassia must confront her fear of exposure and decide whether connection is worth vulnerability.\n\n**Growth**: Cassia eventually chooses to share more deliberately, on her own terms. Her writing becomes published, recognized.
