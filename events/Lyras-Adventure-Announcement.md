## Detailed Account

Lyra has always been the restless one—curious about what lies beyond, eager to explore. While Elara found her calling in engineering and stayed close to home, Lyra felt the pull of distant stars. Her fascination was sparked years ago during the family's visit to Aurora, when she discovered the archives and heard stories of expeditions to unknown territories.

Now, as a young adult, Lyra announces what those who know her have perhaps already sensed: she intends to become a space explorer, to venture beyond the familiar worlds of Astravian civilization and discover what else the universe holds.

For Calista, the announcement brings complex emotions. There is pride in Lyra's courage and clarity of purpose—she has found her path, just as Calista found hers in art. There is joy in seeing her daughter pursue her passion. But there is also fear, the parent's eternal fear for a child facing danger.

She thinks of Joren, of how quickly life can end, of the risks that exploration entails. But she also thinks of her own parents, how they let her find her own way even when it worried them. She knows she must do the same for Lyra.

Calista and Aris express their support, their love, their concerns—openly and honestly, as they have raised their family to communicate. They ask questions, understand the plan, and ultimately give Lyra their blessing.
