## Detailed Account

This dream is different from the others. Rather than meeting transcended consciousness in a symbolic space, Calista finds herself inside a memory—experiencing what seems to be the actual moment her five parents first came together.

She sees Maia young, younger than Calista has ever known her—full of the same quiet grace but unmarked by the years of experience that defined the mother Calista knew. She sees Arin, Selene, Dorian, and Sage in their youth, recognizing their essences despite the unfamiliar faces of their younger selves.

And she witnesses the moment their constellation formed—the connection that would eventually span lifetimes, produce three children (Kael, Calista, and Lyra), and create the family that shaped Calista's entire existence.

Experiencing this moment is profoundly moving. Calista understands that this gift comes from within Lumen—from her parents who, having transcended, can share their memories more directly than was ever possible in life. They are giving her access to their beginning, to the origin of everything she came from.

The dream offers perspective. Her five parents were once young, unknown to each other, with their entire story ahead of them. Everything that followed—the birth of Kael, then Calista, then Lyra, their childhoods, their adult lives—was seeded in this moment she now witnesses.
