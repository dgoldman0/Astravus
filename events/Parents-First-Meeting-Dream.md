## Detailed Account

This dream is different from the others. Rather than meeting transcended consciousness in a symbolic space, Calista finds herself inside a memory—experiencing what seems to be the actual moment her parents first met.

She sees Maia young, younger than Calista has ever known her—full of the same quiet grace but unmarked by the years of experience that defined the mother Calista knew. She sees Kael in his youth, recognizing his essence despite the unfamiliar face of his younger self.

And she witnesses the moment something sparked between them. The look, the word, the connection that would eventually lead to a partnership that would span lifetimes, produce children, and create the family that shaped Calista's entire existence.

Experiencing this moment is profoundly moving. Calista understands that this gift comes from within Lumen—from her parents who, having transcended, can share their memories more directly than was ever possible in life. They are giving her access to their beginning, to the origin of everything she came from.

The dream offers perspective. Her parents were once young, unknown to each other, with their entire story ahead of them. Everything that followed—Calista's birth, her childhood, her adult life—was seeded in this moment she now witnesses.
