## Detailed Account

The moment of Elara's birth echoes across Calista's life—connecting her to the stories her parents told of her own first breath, to the countless generations of Astravians who have welcomed new life, and forward to all the moments yet to come.

The birth itself is both universal and utterly unique. Calista experiences the profound physical reality of bringing new life into the world, supported by Aris's presence and their mind-link that allows them to share the experience more fully than would otherwise be possible.

When Elara takes her first breath—that small gasp that means a new consciousness has entered the world—Calista feels something shift fundamentally in her being. She is no longer just daughter, partner, artist. She is now mother, with all the fierce love and profound responsibility that entails.

Looking into Elara's eyes for the first time, Calista sees both the stranger her child is and the family she comes from. There are echoes of Aris, of herself, of Maia and Kael. Yet Elara is already entirely herself—a new person beginning her own journey.

The first days are a blur of wonder and exhaustion, of learning this new person and learning herself as a parent. Maia is there with quiet wisdom, sharing knowledge from her own experience raising Calista. The community too enfolds them in support.
