## Detailed Account

Core Integration represents one of the most significant moments in any Astravian's life. At thirty-five, Calista has reached the developmental stage where her biology can support this profound transformation—the awakening of her ability to form direct mind-to-mind connections with other integrated Astravians.

The process itself is both biological and deeply personal. Calista's nervous system undergoes changes that enable her to project and receive thoughts, emotions, and experiences directly from other minds. But this physical transformation is intertwined with psychological and spiritual preparation—a readiness to be truly known by others and to know them in return.

When the integration completes, Calista's perception of the world shifts fundamentally. She can sense the presence of other integrated minds around her, feel the collective pulse of Astravian consciousness. For the first time, she truly understands what her parents meant when they spoke of being "one with Lumen."

The experience is overwhelming at first—the sudden availability of others' thoughts and feelings, the need to learn new boundaries and new forms of intimacy. But it also fills her with a sense of connection she never knew she was missing.
