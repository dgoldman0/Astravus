## Setting

**Location:** The treehouse in Maia's garden  
**Time Period:** Calista's childhood  
**Conditions:** During planning for an adventure

## Description

The children's joy was sometimes overshadowed by conflict. One afternoon, while they were playing in the treehouse, a disagreement broke out between Joren and Calista. Joren, ever the leader, insisted that they follow his plan for finding a mysterious artifact, while Calista had her own ideas about how they should proceed.

"You always want to be in charge, Joren!" Calista snapped, frustration bubbling up inside her.

"And you always think your ideas are better!" he shot back, his face flushing with anger.

### Cassia's Intervention

Cassia, sensing the tension, tried to mediate. "Hey, let's calm down," she said gently. "We're a team, remember? We need to work together."

### The Familiars' Response

The pets also reacted to the conflict:
- **Shadow**, who usually stayed out of arguments, jumped onto the table between them, meowing loudly as if to say, "Listen to Cassia!"
- **Barkley** sat down and whined softly, looking between Joren and Calista with concerned eyes
- **Nibble** ran circles around them, trying to lighten the mood with her antics

### Resolution

Cassia's words, combined with the pets' actions, reminded them of the importance of cooperation. They reluctantly agreed to put aside their differences and find a compromise.

It wasn't always easy, but through these disagreements, they learned valuable lessons about communication, empathy, and the strength of their friendship.
