## Detailed Account

Astravian constellations are not static structures but living relationships that can grow and change over time. When Kael forms a constellation with Sage and Sol, it represents an evolution of family bonds in an unexpected direction—Sage, who was one of Kael's own parents, now becomes his romantic partner.

This transition, while perhaps unusual by other standards, reflects the Astravian understanding that relationships can transform as people grow. Sage and Kael's bond, built over decades of family connection, deepened into something romantic. Sol, joining them, brings new perspectives and energy.

For Calista, witnessing her brother's constellation formation brings complex emotions. There is joy in seeing Kael find love and partnership. There is a shift in understanding as Sage, who helped raise her, now becomes her sister-in-law of sorts. The family dynamics evolve, but the love remains.

Sage and Sol bring new personalities and perspectives into the extended family. They become additional aunt and uncle figures to Elara, additional sources of wisdom and connection for Calista herself.

The ceremony itself reflects Astravian values of community and transparency. The constellation formation is witnessed by the community, blessed by their collective presence, and celebrated as an expansion of the bonds that hold Lumen together.
