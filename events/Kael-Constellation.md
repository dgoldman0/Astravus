## Detailed Account

Astravian constellations are not static structures but living relationships that can grow and change over time. When Kael forms a constellation with Sage and Sol—while maintaining his bond with Maia—it represents an expansion of love rather than a replacement.

For Calista, witnessing her father's constellation expansion brings complex emotions. There is joy in seeing her parents' capacity for love grow, wonder at the depth of Astravian relationships, and perhaps some adjustment as family dynamics shift.

Sage and Sol bring new personalities, new perspectives, and new forms of love into the family. They become not just Kael's partners but part of the broader family structure—additional grandparents to Elara and Lyra, additional sources of wisdom and connection for Calista herself.

The ceremony itself reflects Astravian values of community and transparency. The constellation formation is witnessed by the community, blessed by their collective presence, and celebrated as an expansion of the bonds that hold Lumina together.

Maia's grace in welcoming Sage and Sol demonstrates the Astravian understanding that love is not diminished by being shared. Her relationship with Kael remains central even as it makes room for new connections.
