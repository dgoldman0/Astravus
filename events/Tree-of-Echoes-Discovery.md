## Description

One clear afternoon, Calista, Kael, and Lyra decided to explore a new path leading into a dense thicket of trees. Shadow followed them, her sleek black form blending with the shadows, while Barkley bounded ahead, his golden fur shining in the skylight.

"Come on, slowpokes!" Kael called, his voice full of excitement. "I think I see something up ahead!"

They hurried to catch up, their curiosity piqued. As they pushed through the underbrush, they emerged into a small clearing. In the center stood an ancient tree with gnarled branches and a hollow trunk.

"Wow," Lyra whispered, her eyes wide with wonder. "It looks so old."

### The Tree's History

Calista recognized the tree from one of Dorian's stories: "This must be the Tree of Echoes. It was transplanted here when Lumen was founded. The tree was already ancient, grown from a seed gifted by an ancient Astravus. It symbolizes our deep bond and connection to our heritage."

### The Whispers

"Let's see if we can hear anything," Kael suggested, stepping closer. He leaned in, pressing his ear against the trunk.

At first, there was silence. Then, faint whispers began to emerge—like distant echoes of voices long past. The sound wasn't literal voices but rather the creaking of the old tree creating an illusion of speech. The children all listened, captivated by the mysterious sounds.

"It's amazing," Lyra said softly. "It really does sound like it's talking to us."

They stood there for a long time, each lost in the ancient tree's whispers, feeling a profound connection to their past and the living ship that had given them this remarkable gift.
