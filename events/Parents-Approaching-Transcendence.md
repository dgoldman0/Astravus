## Detailed Account

Transcendence is not death in the traditional sense—it is transformation, the dissolution of individual consciousness into the greater whole of Lumen. The person does not cease to exist; they become part of something larger, their essence joining countless others who have transcended before them.

Yet for those who remain behind in physical form, transcendence carries the weight of loss. The individual they knew and loved will no longer be present in the same way. The parent who held them as a child, who guided them through life's challenges, who celebrated their achievements—that specific person will merge into the collective.

Maia and Kael approach their transcendence with the grace that has characterized their lives. They have lived fully, loved deeply, and contributed meaningfully. They have raised a daughter who has raised her own children. They have seen the cycle continue. They are ready.

For Calista, this period is profound. She finds herself oscillating between grief for what she will lose and peace about where her parents are going. The dreamlike experiences she has begun having—messages from within Lumen—hint at what awaits them all.

Time with her parents becomes more precious. Conversations carry more weight. Old memories are revisited, new ones are made. Calista helps prepare for the ceremony, learning the traditions she will one day follow herself.
