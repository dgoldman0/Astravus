## Description

Exploring Lumen was not without its challenges. One day, while the siblings were playing near the edge of a small pond, Lyra slipped and fell into the water. The pond was shallow, but the suddenness of the fall startled her, and she began to panic.

"Lyra!" Calista shouted, rushing to her sister's side. "Are you okay?"

"I can't swim!" Lyra cried, her eyes wide with fear.

"Hold on, Lyra!" Kael said, reaching out to her. "We're here."

Together, the siblings helped Lyra to the edge of the pond. Barkley barked anxiously nearby, and Shadow paced, her green eyes watchful and concerned.

"You're safe now," Calista said, hugging Lyra tightly. "It's okay to be scared, but remember, we're always here for you."

"Thank you," Lyra sniffed, her fear slowly subsiding. "I'll be more careful next time."
