## Description

Arin's workshop was a place of endless fascination. The air was filled with the metallic scent of machinery and the hum of various gadgets. Tools lined the walls, prototypes sat in various stages of completion, and the workshop buzzed with the energy of creation.

One day, while Arin was working on a new device, Calista accidentally knocked over a jar of screws, sending them scattering across the floor.

"Oh no!" Calista exclaimed, feeling a wave of guilt. "I'm so sorry, Arin."

Arin looked at the mess and then at Calista, their expression calm and understanding. Their use of her full name—"Calista"—signaled concern rather than anger.

"Mistakes happen, Calista. The important thing is to learn from them."

"But I ruined your work," Calista said, her voice small and worried.

"You didn't ruin it," Arin reassured her. "You just gave us a chance to make it better. Let's fix it together."

With Arin's patient guidance, Calista learned how to repair the affected component, understanding the importance of patience and perseverance. Arin showed her how to sort the screws, how to carefully examine what had been disrupted, and how methodical work could restore order from chaos.

## Notes

- Arin specializes in biomechanical interface design—technology that integrates with living systems
- Their quirk of humming while working (mechanical rhythms matching what they're building) may have been present during this scene
- Arin is missing the tip of their left pinky finger from an earlier workshop accident—declined regeneration as a reminder to be careful
- This workshop later becomes the setting for Arin mentoring Elara
