## Detailed Account

The story of the Three Siblings told of [[Shadow]] alongside [[Sol]] and [[Lumen]]—three aspects of existence that together form wholeness. In her transcendent dreams, Calista has encountered the light; now she must journey into the dark.

Nyx appears not as a frightening figure but as a necessary one—the keeper of all that has been hidden, forgotten, or pushed away. To truly transcend, Calista must integrate her shadow: the grief she has not fully processed, the mistakes she has not forgiven herself for, the aspects of her nature she has not fully acknowledged.

The journey through Nyx's realm is challenging but not harmful. Calista confronts old wounds—the loss of Joren, the ending of her relationship with Lysandra, moments of failure or harm she has caused. She sees these not as accusations but as parts of herself that have been waiting for acknowledgment.

Nyx guides her toward acceptance. The shadow is not the enemy of light but its complement. The painful experiences of her life have shaped her as surely as the joyful ones. Integrating them is not about forgetting or excusing but about wholeness.

When Calista emerges from the shadow realm, she is more complete. Parts of herself that had been in conflict are now at peace. She carries her whole life—light and shadow together—into her approaching transcendence.
