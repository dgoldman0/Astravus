## Detailed Account

Over steaming drinks in a familiar café, Calista and Cassia fall into the kind of conversation only possible between people who have known each other since childhood. The years have changed them both—Cassia has established herself as a writer, Calista has built a life with Aris and their creative partnership—but the core of their friendship remains.

They speak of their shared history: the games they played as children, the treehouse where they spent countless hours, the tragedy of losing Joren that shaped them both. They marvel at how far they've come from those two little girls who first met in a sunlit garden.

The conversation turns to the present—their work, their relationships, their hopes and concerns. Cassia speaks of her writing, the stories she's crafting. Calista shares the joys and challenges of her partnership with Aris, their plans for the future.

There's comfort in being truly known by someone. With Cassia, Calista can be completely herself—not the artist the community admires, not the partner or daughter, but simply Calista, the person she has always been beneath all those roles.

They speak too of the future, of what lies ahead as they continue through life. The conversation doesn't avoid difficult topics—mortality, transcendence, the changes that time brings—but addresses them with the ease of deep trust.
