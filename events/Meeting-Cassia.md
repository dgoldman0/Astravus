## Description

Calista's circle of friends began to widen as she grew older. Among her most significant childhood companions was Cassia, whom she met at a community gathering.

When Calista first encountered Cassia, the girl was in the middle of telling a story about a mythical creature. Her voice was light and musical, perfectly suited for storytelling, and she drew listeners in with every word. Her deep, sparkling green eyes were filled with wonder and mischief.

Cassia noticed Calista's interest and paused her story to extend an invitation: "Do you want to join our adventure?"

From that moment, they were inseparable. Cassia's imaginative nature and gift for storytelling complemented Calista's artistic sensibilities. Their friendship would span their entire lives, evolving through childhood adventures, adolescent challenges, and adult creative collaborations.
