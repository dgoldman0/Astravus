## Detailed Account

The first dream arrives unexpectedly. Calista finds herself in a space that is neither quite memory nor quite imagination—a place suffused with warm light, where familiar presences seem to hover just beyond perception. She wakes with a profound sense of peace and a feeling that she has been somewhere real.

The dreams continue, each one offering different experiences. Sometimes she encounters what feel like memories not her own—glimpses of lives lived centuries ago, experiences that belong to others who now form part of Lumen. Sometimes she feels the presence of her parents, not as they were in life but as they are now—transformed, expanded, part of something greater.

Calista comes to understand that these dreams are the beginning of her transition. Her consciousness is starting to attune to Lumen, preparing for the eventual dissolution of her individual self into the collective. The boundary between her and all-that-has-been is growing thin.

The dreams are not frightening, though they are profound. They offer comfort—assurance that transcendence is not an ending but a transformation. They connect her to everyone she has lost and to everyone she will join.
