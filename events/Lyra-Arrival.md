## Detailed Account

The birth of a second child is different from the first. Where Elara's arrival was an entry into the unknown, Lyra's comes with experience—though each child is their own person with their own arrival story.

Calista approaches Lyra's birth with the wisdom of having done this before, yet remains open to the uniqueness of this new being. From the first moments, it's clear that Lyra is different from Elara—not in value but in nature, in the particular spark of personality already visible.

For Elara, this is a major transition—no longer the only child, now a sibling. Calista and Aris are attentive to this shift, helping Elara understand and embrace the new family member.

Lyra brings her own energy into the family. Where Elara shows one set of inclinations, Lyra shows another. Even as an infant, hints of the adventurous spirit that will later lead her to explore space are visible—a restlessness, a curiosity about everything just beyond reach.

The family constellation has grown, and with it the complexity and richness of their life together.
