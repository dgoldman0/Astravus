## Description

One evening, after a particularly lively day, the children gathered in Sage's room. Lyra had been upset earlier after a disagreement with Kael about who would get the last piece of dessert. Sage sensed her lingering sadness and gently lifted her onto their lap.

"Do you know what helps when we're feeling down?" Sage asked softly.

Lyra shook her head.

"A good story," Sage continued, "and a reminder that even when we disagree, we are always there for each other."

### The Story

Sage told a tale about three siblings—Aria, Bram, and Cora—who lived aboard a great Astravus traveling through the cosmos. Each sibling was different:
- **Aria** was adventurous and loved exploring
- **Bram** was thoughtful and enjoyed solving puzzles
- **Cora** was creative, always crafting beautiful art

When their community's central water system ran dry, each sibling proposed a different solution:
- Aria wanted to explore and find a new water source
- Bram wanted to analyze why the system failed
- Cora wanted to create something to help find the answer

At first, they argued about whose approach was best. But when they tried each plan individually, none worked completely:
- Aria's exploration found nothing
- Bram's analysis was too slow
- Cora's creativity alone couldn't solve the practical problem

Finally, they combined their strengths:
- Bram discovered mineral deposits had clogged the pipes
- Cora designed a filtration system to clear them efficiently
- Working together, they restored water to the community

The siblings learned that their different strengths made them stronger together, and their willingness to listen and adapt helped them succeed.
