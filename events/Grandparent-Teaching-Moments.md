## Detailed Account

Astravian children are raised by a constellation of adults, and for Elara, this includes the rich presence of five grandparents—Calista's own parents. Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, and Sage each bring unique gifts to their grandchild's development.

Maia shares her knowledge of gardening and her deep connection to natural rhythms. She takes Elara into her garden just as she once did with young Calista, teaching her to feel the life in growing things, to understand the patience required for cultivation. Her gentle presence offers a particular kind of wisdom.

Arin brings their precise, inventive approach to the workshop. In that space of creation and repair, they show Elara how to work with their hands, how to think through challenges, how to appreciate the beauty of well-made things. Elara's eventual engineering career is directly nurtured here.

Selene fills the world with music, teaching Elara to hear the patterns in sound and to express emotion through melody. Her acoustic architecture extends beyond performance to understanding how spaces themselves can sing.

Dorian keeps the stories alive, weaving tales of Astravian history and family memory that give Elara a sense of her place in a vast tapestry of time.

Sage provides the emotional grounding—the caregiver's presence that helps Elara navigate her feelings and understand herself.

Kael, though Elara's uncle rather than grandparent, also contributes through his constellation with Sage and Sol. His adventurous spirit and his own experience building a family offer additional perspectives.

For Calista, watching her parents with her child creates a beautiful sense of continuity. She sees echoes of her own childhood in how Maia guides Elara through the garden, how Arin patiently explains something in the workshop. The cycle continues.
