## Detailed Account

Astravian children are raised by a constellation of adults, and for Elara and Lyra, this includes the rich presence of their grandparents. Maia, Kael, Sage, and Sol each bring unique gifts to the children's development.

Maia shares her knowledge of gardening and her deep connection to natural rhythms. She takes the children into her garden just as she once did with young Calista, teaching them to feel the life in growing things, to understand the patience required for cultivation. Her gentle presence offers a particular kind of wisdom.

Kael brings his thoughtful approach to craftsmanship and problem-solving. In his workshop, he shows Elara and Lyra how to work with their hands, how to think through challenges, how to appreciate the beauty of well-made things. His quiet strength provides a grounding influence.

Sage and Sol, joining the family through their constellation with Kael, offer additional perspectives and skills. Their presence demonstrates to the children that family can expand, that love grows rather than divides.

For Calista, watching her parents with her children creates a beautiful sense of continuity. She sees echoes of her own childhood in how Maia guides Lyra through the garden, how Kael patiently explains something to Elara. The cycle continues.
