## Description

Evenings in the family home were often filled with the soothing sounds of Selene's music. Her melodies seemed to wash away the day's worries, creating an atmosphere of peace and creative inspiration. The music room was Selene's domain—a space she had designed with acoustic architecture in mind, where every surface contributed to the perfect sound.

One evening, Selene invited Calista to sit beside her at the piano.

"Come sit with me, Cali," Selene said, patting the seat next to her.

Calista sat down, and Selene handed her a small flute—an instrument sized for a child's hands.

"Try playing this melody," Selene encouraged.

Calista took a deep breath and began to play. The notes were shaky at first, hesitant and uncertain. But Selene's encouraging smile gave her confidence. Gradually, the notes became clearer, blending with the music Selene played on the piano.

"Beautiful," Selene praised, her violet eyes twinkling with pride. "Music speaks to the heart. You just have to listen."

Shadow, the family cat, curled up in a corner of the music room, her ears twitching in time with the music. Nibble scurried around, seemingly dancing to the rhythm.

## Notes

- Selene is an acoustic architect—she designs the soundscapes of Lumen's spaces, understanding that how a room sounds shapes how people feel
- Her quirk of perfect pitch means she hears when anything is off-tune, including door hinges and ventilation systems
- She experiences synesthesia: specific musical notes feel like distinct emotions (C major = "comfortable reunion")
- Her music continues to fill the family home throughout Calista's life
