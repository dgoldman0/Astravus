## Description

One morning, Maia led Calista into her beloved garden—a place of endless wonder filled with vibrant colors and sweet fragrances. The garden was not merely decorative; it was part of Lumen's ecological systems, contributing to air and water cycles through botanical intervention.

Maia handed Calista a small seed. "This seed will grow into a beautiful flower if we take good care of it."

Calista held the seed carefully, feeling its tiny, smooth surface. "What kind of flower will it be?"

"A sunflower," Maia replied with a warm smile. "Tall and bright, just like you."

Together, they dug a small hole in the rich, dark soil. Maia's hands—warm and gentle, permanently stained green and brown at the fingertips from decades of soil work—guided Calista's smaller hands as they planted the seed and covered it with earth.

Maia explained how the seed would sprout and grow, reaching for the skylight that filtered through Lumen's living structures. "Remember, plants need love and patience. Just like people."
