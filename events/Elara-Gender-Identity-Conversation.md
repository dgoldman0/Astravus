## Detailed Account

Elara approaches Calista with the particular nervousness of a child about to share something deeply personal. She has been thinking about her gender identity, working through her understanding of herself, and now she's ready to share: she identifies as female.

Calista receives this information with the warmth and acceptance that defines her parenting. There is no surprise or hesitation—only love and affirmation. She thanks Elara for trusting her with something so important and asks what Elara needs from her.

The conversation that follows is an opportunity for Calista to demonstrate the values she was raised with. Just as her five parents allowed Calista to find her own path, Calista creates space for Elara to be fully herself. She asks questions not to challenge but to understand—what pronouns feel right, what name if any she prefers, how Elara wants to navigate this with others.

Calista shares some of her own journey of self-discovery, connecting across generations while respecting that Elara's experience is uniquely hers. She affirms that identity is personal and evolving, that there is no wrong way to be oneself.

The conversation ends with Elara feeling seen and supported—knowing that her parents are her allies in becoming who she truly is.
