## Dialogue

*One rainy afternoon, Elara came home from a challenging day at her studies, her face clouded with frustration. Sage welcomed her with open arms.*

**Sage:** "Come here, sweetheart. Tell me what's on your mind."

*Elara sighed, tears brimming in her eyes.*

**Elara:** "I tried so hard, but I couldn't get the math problems right. I feel so stupid."

*Sage stroked her hair gently.*

**Sage:** "You are not stupid, Elara. Everyone struggles with something at times. What matters is that you keep trying and don't give up. Let's take a break, and then we can work on it together. How about we bake some cookies to cheer you up?"

*Elara's frown turned into a small smile.*

**Elara:** "That sounds nice."

*In the kitchen, they mixed ingredients, the scent of baking cookies filling the air. As they worked, Sage shared words of encouragement and stories of their own challenges and triumphs.*

**Sage:** "You see, Elara, we all have our own paths to walk. And along the way, we learn, grow, and become stronger."
