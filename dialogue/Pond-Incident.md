While playing near a small pond, young Lyra slips and falls into the water. Despite the pond being shallow, she panics. This moment shows sibling care and the protective bonds within the family.

## Participants
- **Calista** - Middle sibling, protective and reassuring
- **Lyra** - Younger sister, frightened
- **Kael** - Older brother, helpful

## Dialogue

**Calista:** "Lyra! Are you okay?"

**Lyra:** "I can't swim!"

**Kael:** "Hold on, Lyra! We're here."

*Together, they helped her to the edge of the pond. Barkley barked anxiously, and Shadow paced nearby, her green eyes watchful.*

**Calista:** "You're safe now. It's okay to be scared, but remember, we're always here for you."

**Lyra:** "Thank you. I'll be more careful next time."
