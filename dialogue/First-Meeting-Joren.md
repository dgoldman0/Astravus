# First Meeting with Joren

## Context
Joren leads a group of children on an impromptu adventure through the construction zones of Lumen. His infectious energy and competitive spirit immediately draw Calista into his world. Joren's communication style is unmistakable: enthusiastic, competitive, always moving—he laughs with his whole body and turns everything into an adventure. For young Calista, who often lives inside her own imagination, Joren represents a different kind of creative energy: the joy of doing rather than just seeing.

## Participants
- **Joren** - New friend, adventurous leader with infectious enthusiasm
- **Calista** - Young protagonist, rising to the challenge

## Setting
*The construction zones of Lumen were technically off-limits to children—which, of course, made them irresistible. Half-built structures stretched toward the dome like the bones of future dreams, and temporary walkways created a maze of possibility. The maintenance crews had gone home for the day, and the area hummed with the particular silence of unfinished things.*

## Dialogue

*Calista was sketching the geometric patterns of a half-assembled support beam when she heard the sound: laughter, bright and infectious, followed by the thunder of running feet.*

*A group of children burst around the corner, led by a boy whose tousled blond hair caught the afternoon light like a beacon. His eyes were the blue of deep water, and even from a distance, Calista could feel the pull of his energy—like a planet with its own gravity.*

**Joren:** *(calling back to the others, voice full of joy)* "Come ON, slowpokes! The best stuff is always in the places they tell you not to go!"

*He spotted Calista and changed direction without hesitation, skidding to a stop in front of her. His grin was enormous and entirely unself-conscious.*

**Joren:** "Hey! You! Are you just going to sit there drawing, or do you want to actually *do* something?"

*Calista looked up, startled by the directness—and the complete lack of judgment in it. He wasn't mocking her drawing; he was offering something different.*

**Calista:** "What kind of something?"

*Joren's eyes lit up. He gestured expansively at the construction zone around them.*

**Joren:** "We're exploring! There's a whole section over there that's almost finished—I heard there's a new observation deck they haven't opened yet. First one there gets to name it!"

*He bounced on his feet, practically vibrating with energy.*

**Joren:** "I'm Joren, by the way. And I'm going to win. But you could try to beat me!"

*Something sparked in Calista—a competitive edge she didn't usually feel. Maybe it was the challenge in his voice. Maybe it was the way he made "exploring" sound like the most important thing in the world.*

**Calista:** *(standing up, tucking her sketchpad into her bag)* "I'm Calista. And you're on."

*She pointed to a ladder she'd noticed earlier, one that looked like a shortcut.*

**Calista:** "But I bet I'll find something amazing before you do. I've been watching this place for an hour. I know things you don't."

*Joren's grin widened impossibly.*

**Joren:** "OH! Now we're talking! A secret-keeper! I love secret-keepers."

*He laughed—a sound that came from his whole body, shoulders shaking, head thrown back.*

**Joren:** "Okay, okay, you're on my team now. We're going to find the BEST stuff. Come on!"

*Before Calista could protest that she'd said they were competing, not teaming up, Joren had grabbed her hand and pulled her into a run. The other children followed, and suddenly Calista was part of something—an adventure, a group, a moment that felt like the beginning of something important.*

*As they ran, Joren glanced back at her, eyes bright.*

**Joren:** "You're pretty fast for an artist! I thought artists just sat around all day!"

**Calista:** *(breathless but smiling)* "And I thought adventurers couldn't sit still long enough to notice anything!"

*Joren laughed again, delighted.*

**Joren:** "Fair! Fair! We're going to be good friends, Calista. I can tell."

*And he was right.*
