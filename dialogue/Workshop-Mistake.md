# Workshop Mistake

## Context
In Arin's workshop, young Calista accidentally knocks over a jar of screws. This moment establishes Arin's philosophy that mistakes are opportunities for learning—a lesson that stays with Calista throughout her life. Arin's practical, hands-on approach to both engineering and parenting is on full display: they think through building, speak in mechanical metaphors, and hum while they work.

## Participants
- **Arin** - Engineer parent, patient and pragmatic, thinks with their hands
- **Calista** - Child, feeling guilty about the accident

## Dialogue

*The workshop hummed with quiet industry—a tune Arin hummed under their breath as they adjusted a delicate mechanism, fingers moving with the precision of someone who thought in gears and systems. Calista sat on a stool nearby, watching with wide eyes, her legs swinging above the floor. She reached for a better view of the glittering copper coils—*

*CRASH.*

*The jar of screws hit the ground, and a hundred tiny metal pieces scattered across the workshop floor like startled insects.*

**Calista:** *(freezing, eyes filling with tears)* "Oh no! I'm so sorry, Arin!"

*Arin stopped humming. They set down their tools—careful, deliberate—and surveyed the mess. Then they looked at Calista, their expression calm as still water.*

**Arin:** *(concise, warm)* "That's quite a spread. Could use a system for this."

*They knelt beside the scattered screws, already sorting by size with practiced efficiency.*

**Calista:** *(voice wobbling)* "But I ruined your work. I wasn't supposed to touch anything."

*Arin paused, hands still for a moment. When they spoke, their voice was steady—practical, but kind.*

**Arin:** "Cali, look at me."

*Calista looked up, tears threatening to spill.*

**Arin:** "Mistakes happen. Even the best machines break down sometimes—that's how we learn what needs reinforcing. The important thing isn't the fall. It's what we build after."

**Calista:** *(sniffling)* "You're not angry?"

*Arin began humming again, a soft rhythmic tune, as they handed Calista a small magnetic wand.*

**Arin:** "Here. This tool finds metal. Wave it slowly, and let's see how many we can collect. Think of it like... troubleshooting. When a system fails, you don't throw it away. You find the loose parts, tighten them up, and make it stronger than before."

*Calista took the wand, still uncertain, but Arin's calm demeanor steadied her. Together, they swept the wand across the floor, screws clicking softly as they gathered.*

**Calista:** "How do you always know how to fix things?"

*Arin chuckled—a sound like gears clicking into place.*

**Arin:** "Practice. And patience. Every mistake I ever made taught me something new. Some of my best inventions started as accidents." 

*They held up a screw between two fingers.*

**Arin:** "See this? Wrong size for what I was building. But now I'm thinking—it might be perfect for something else. A smaller project. Sometimes the pieces that seem wrong just haven't found their place yet."

*Calista smiled, the tears forgotten.*

**Calista:** "Like a puzzle."

**Arin:** *(nodding, resuming their hum)* "Exactly like a puzzle. And you, little one, are already learning how to solve them."

## Calista's Internal Reflection
*My parents only used my full name when they were concerned—but Arin always called me Cali, even in moments like these. How many times did I worry about making mistakes? Did I realize then how much each mistake was an opportunity to learn and grow? Arin taught me that broken things could be rebuilt, and that sometimes the breaking was the beginning, not the end.*
