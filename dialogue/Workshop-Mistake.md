## Context
In Arin's workshop, young Calista accidentally knocks over a jar of screws. This moment establishes Arin's philosophy that mistakes are opportunities for learning—a lesson that stays with Calista throughout her life.

## Participants
- **Arin** - Engineer parent, patient and pragmatic
- **Calista** - Child, feeling guilty about the accident

## Dialogue

*Calista accidentally knocked over a jar of screws, sending them scattering across the floor.*

**Calista:** "Oh no! I'm so sorry, Arin."

*Arin looked at the mess and then at Calista, their expression calm.*

**Arin:** "Mistakes happen, Calista. The important thing is to learn from them."

**Calista:** "But I ruined your work."

**Arin:** "You didn't ruin it. You just gave us a chance to make it better. Let's fix it together."

## Calista's Internal Reflection
*My parents only used my full name when they were concerned. How many times did I worry about making mistakes? Did I realize then how much each mistake was an opportunity to learn and grow?*
