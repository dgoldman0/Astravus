## Context

## Participants

- **Elara** - Granddaughter, curious learner

## Dialogue

*One sunny afternoon, Maia and Elara were in the garden, surrounded by an array of colorful flowers and lush greenery.*

**Elara:** "Grandma Maia, why do some plants need more sunlight than others?"

*Maia smiled, wiping dirt from her hands.*

**Maia:** "Well, Elara, it's because different plants come from different parts of the world. Each one has adapted to thrive in its unique environment. Some love the sun, like these sunflowers here, while others prefer the shade, like those ferns over there."

*Elara's eyes widened with curiosity.*

**Elara:** "So, they're like us? Each one special in its own way?"

**Maia:** "Exactly. And just like people, plants need the right care and environment to grow strong and healthy."
