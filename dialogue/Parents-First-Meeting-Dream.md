## Dialogue

*The dream took Calista back to a time before she was born, where she saw her parents meeting for the first time. It was at a community celebration in Lumen's central plaza. The plaza was alive with music and laughter, bioluminescent plants casting a magical glow.*

*Arin was demonstrating a new piece of technology he had invented, while Selene played a melody on her harp that captivated the crowd. Maia, drawn by the music, wandered over and struck up a conversation with Arin.*

**Maia:** "It's amazing how your music and technology blend so seamlessly."

**Arin:** "It's all about finding harmony. Just like in nature, where everything has its place."

*Their eyes met, and in that moment, a connection was forged. Calista watched as they laughed and shared stories, their bond growing stronger with each passing moment. It was a scene of pure joy and possibility, a beginning that would eventually lead to the family she cherished.*
