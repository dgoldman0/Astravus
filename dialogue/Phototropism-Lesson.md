# Phototropism Lesson

## Context
A teaching moment in Maia's garden where scientific wonder meets parental guidance. This scene deepens Maia's character—showing how she weaves botanical science with emotional wisdom, always speaking to plants as living confidants. Young Calista's artistic eye begins to see patterns and light in ways that will define her life's work.

## Participants
- **Maia** - Botanist parent, explains scientific concepts through wonder and warmth
- **Calista** - Young Calista, fascinated by natural phenomena, already seeing the world visually

## Dialogue

*Afternoon light slanted through the garden dome at a low angle, and Maia had positioned a young seedling near the window. Over the past week, Calista had watched it lean—first slightly, then dramatically—toward the glass. Today, it curved like a dancer mid-bow.*

**Calista:** *(tilting her head to match the plant's angle)* "Why is it bending like that? Is it tired?"

*Maia laughed softly, kneeling beside the pot. She stroked one of the seedling's leaves with gentle fingers.*

**Maia:** *(to the plant)* "You're working so hard, aren't you? Stretching toward what you need."

*She looked up at Calista, her voice taking on the patient, wondering tone she used when teaching.*

**Maia:** "It's called phototropism, little one. Plants grow toward light because light is their food, their energy, their life. Watch—" 

*She rotated the pot slowly.*

**Maia:** "In a few days, it will turn again. Always reaching. Always seeking what helps it grow."

**Calista:** *(watching intently, her mind already translating the scene into colors)* "The way the light hits it... it looks like it's glowing. Like it's happy."

*Maia's eyes softened with recognition.*

**Maia:** "Perhaps it is. Plants feel things too, in their own quiet way. They know when they're cared for. They know when someone speaks kindly to them."

*She reached out and touched Calista's arm gently.*

**Maia:** "You know, Cali, you're a bit like this seedling. You turn toward the things that light you up—the colors, the shapes, the beauty you see everywhere. That's your phototropism. That's how you grow."

**Calista:** *(quiet for a moment, considering)* "So everyone has something they reach toward?"

**Maia:** "Everyone and everything. The trick is learning what light is truly yours, and having the patience to keep growing toward it, even when the path is slow."

*She pressed a small envelope into Calista's hand—a few seeds from last season's sunflowers.*

**Maia:** "Here. For when you want to watch something grow and remember what we learned today."

*Calista clutched the seeds like treasure, already imagining a row of golden flowers, each one painted in light.*
