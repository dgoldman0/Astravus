## Dialogue

*When Lyra finally arrived, the entire family gathered to welcome her. She looked radiant, her eyes sparkling with the thrill of new discoveries.*

**Lyra:** "I've missed you all so much. I have so much to tell you about the other Astravii."

*Over the next few weeks, Lyra shared her experiences.*

**Lyra:** "The Astravii are incredibly diverse. Their communities, though 'close' by their standards, are spread out over vast distances. It took years to travel between some of them, even with our advanced technologies. One of the most fascinating experiences was visiting an ancient Astravus, a parent of Nyx. They were thousands of years old, their presence like a living history of our kind."

**Calista:** "What were they like?"

*Lyra's eyes sparkled with the memory.*

**Lyra:** "Their culture was so different, almost like stepping into another world. Their structures were a blend of advanced technology and intricate artistry, creating environments that felt alive in ways unique to their traditions. Each space was a masterpiece, constantly evolving to reflect their values and aesthetics. And their art—oh, Cali, it was like nothing I've ever seen. Sculptures that moved and changed shape, paintings that seemed to come alive with light and emotion."

**Elara:** "Did you bring back any of their technology or art?"

*Lyra nodded, pulling out a small device from her bag.*

**Lyra:** "This is a piece of their adaptive sculpture. It changes form and color based on its environment. It's a small piece, but it carries the essence of their artistic vision."

*Elara's eyes lit up with excitement.*

**Elara:** "That sounds amazing! I'd love to study it."
