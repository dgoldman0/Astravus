# Soup Experiment

## Context
During a family cooking session, Lyra secretly adds a rare spice from Maia's garden to the soup, thinking it would improve the taste. The result is overwhelming and unpleasant, but Maia uses the moment as a teaching opportunity.

## Participants
- **Lyra** - Younger sister, well-intentioned but inexperienced
- **Arin** - Engineer parent, reacting to the taste
- **Maia** - Botanist parent, gentle teacher

## Dialogue

*When they sat down to eat, everyone took a spoonful of the soup and immediately grimaced.*

**Arin:** "Lyra, what did you put in the soup?"

*Lyra looked down, embarrassed.*

**Lyra:** "I found this spice in the garden and thought it would taste good. I didn't think it would be this strong."

**Maia:** "It's wonderful that you wanted to experiment, Lyra, but it's important to understand the properties of ingredients before adding them. Some spices can be very potent."

**Lyra:** "I'm sorry, I just wanted to help."

*Maia hugged her.*

**Maia:** "It's okay, Lyra. Cooking is all about experimentation, but it's also about balance and knowing when to ask for guidance. Let's make another batch together, and I'll show you how to use that spice properly."

## Calista's Internal Aside
*Well, at least we learned that some spices should come with a warning label. Note to self: always taste test before surprising the family with culinary experiments.*
