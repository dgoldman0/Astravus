# First Seed Planting

## Context
One of Calista's earliest memories in Maia's garden. This moment establishes Maia's teaching style and introduces themes of growth, patience, and nurturing that echo throughout Calista's life.

## Participants
- **Maia** - Botanist parent, warm and gentle teaching approach
- **Calista** - Young child, curious and eager to learn

## Dialogue

**Maia:** "Here, Cali. This seed will grow into a beautiful flower if we take good care of it."

**Calista:** "What kind of flower will it be?"

**Maia:** "A sunflower. Tall and bright, just like you."

*Together, they dug a small hole in the rich, dark soil. Maia's hands guided Calista's as they planted the seed and covered it with earth.*

**Maia:** "Remember, plants need love and patience. Just like people."
