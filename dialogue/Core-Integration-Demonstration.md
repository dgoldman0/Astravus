## Dialogue

*One evening, Calista was working late in her studio, experimenting with a new painting technique. The room was quiet, save for the soft hum of integrated devices. As she focused on the canvas, the colors and shapes responded to her thoughts with a fluidity that felt almost magical. Just then, Lyra walked in, curious about her progress.*

**Lyra:** "How's it going?"

*Calista smiled, pausing for a moment.*

**Calista:** "It's incredible, Lyra. The way the colors move with my thoughts... it's like nothing I've ever experienced before."

*Lyra watched as Calista demonstrated, the digital paint flowing effortlessly with her mental commands.*

**Lyra:** "That's amazing. I can't wait until it's my turn."

**Calista:** "You'll love it. It's like a whole new world of possibilities opens up."
