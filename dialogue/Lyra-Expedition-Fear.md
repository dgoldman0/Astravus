# Lyra Expedition Fear

## Context
When Lyra announces her plan to journey to meet other Astravii communities, Calista's fear of losing another loved one—after Joren's death—creates tension between her protective instincts and Lyra's determination. This scene showcases the distinct communication styles of both sisters: Lyra's curious, question-asking nature (she asks in threes), and Calista's visual metaphors and protective worry. Aris provides comfort through their characteristic musical presence.

## Participants
- **Lyra** - Calista's younger sister, determined explorer, asks questions in threes
- **Calista** - Protagonist, worried sibling, speaks in visual metaphors
- **Aris** - Calista's partner, provides comfort through music and presence

## Setting
*The family sitting room glowed with the warm amber light of evening. Lyra had been pacing—as she always did when working up to something big—her footsteps tracing a familiar pattern across the floor. Calista watched her with the attention of someone who knew this restless energy well.*

## Dialogue with Lyra

*Lyra finally stopped pacing and turned to face her sister. Her eyes—bright green, always bright—held that particular intensity that meant she'd made a decision.*

**Lyra:** "Cali, I need to ask you something. Three things, actually."

*She held up three fingers, counting as she spoke.*

**Lyra:** "First: do you remember Dorian's stories about the Wayfinders? The ones who connected the Astravii? Second: do you remember how I felt when we visited Aurora—how I couldn't stop asking about the other communities, the ones even further away? And third..."

*She took a breath.*

**Lyra:** "Do you remember when I was little, and you told me that some people are born with maps in their hearts?"

*Calista's chest tightened. She did remember. She remembered all of it—and she already knew where this was going.*

**Calista:** *(voice careful, controlled)* "I remember, Lyra. You're going to tell me something that terrifies me, aren't you?"

*Lyra moved closer, sitting beside her sister and taking her hand.*

**Lyra:** "I want to journey around and meet other Astravii communities. Learn their stories and experiences. I've been studying, planning, talking to the elders. It's rare, and I know it's risky—but I feel like it's something I need to do."

*Calista closed her eyes. In her mind, she saw Joren—not as he'd been in the accident, but as he'd been that first day in the construction zones, eyes bright with adventure, whole body laughing. The image shifted, darkened—*

**Calista:** *(opening her eyes, voice strained)* "Lyra, it's... the colors in my mind right now are very dark. When I think of you out there, all I can see is—is the painting I never finished. The one with Joren. The one I couldn't bear to look at."

*Lyra squeezed her hand tighter.*

**Lyra:** "I know you're scared. I know why. But Cali—can I ask you three more things?"

*She waited for Calista's reluctant nod.*

**Lyra:** "First: Am I the same as Joren? Do I make the same choices, take the same risks? Second: Have I not been preparing for this my whole life—studying, learning, training? And third..."

*Her voice softened.*

**Lyra:** "If the colors in your mind were bright instead of dark—if you could see me out there, discovering and learning and *growing*—would that picture be beautiful?"

*Calista was silent for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice cracked.*

**Calista:** "It would be beautiful. *You* would be beautiful. But I've already lost one person I loved to adventure, Lyra. I can't—I can't survive losing you too."

*Lyra leaned forward, pressing her forehead to Calista's—a gesture from childhood, from comfort, from home.*

**Lyra:** "You won't lose me. I promise you. I will take every precaution. I will stay in constant communication. And I will carry you with me—all of you—in every step I take."

*Calista felt tears sliding down her cheeks.*

**Calista:** "Promise me. Promise me you'll come back with stories, not—not just become one."

**Lyra:** *(firmly)* "I promise. I will come back. And I'll bring you something beautiful from every place I go. Something for you to paint."

## Later Conversation with Aris

*That night, Calista stood by the window, staring out at the bioluminescent glow of Lumen's gardens. The colors should have been comforting—they usually were—but tonight they seemed muted, uncertain.*

*She heard Aris before she saw them—a soft melody, hummed under their breath, approaching from behind.*

**Aris:** *(humming a few more bars, then speaking gently)* "The tune I'm hearing in my head right now... it's worried. Minor key. Searching for resolution."

*They wrapped an arm around Calista's waist, standing beside her at the window.*

**Aris:** "Want to tell me about it?"

**Calista:** "Lyra. The expedition. I know I should support her—I *do* support her—but every time I close my eyes, I see dark colors. Storm clouds. Unfinished paintings."

*Aris nodded, humming softly—not a tune, just presence.*

**Aris:** "She's strong. Prepared. Brilliant. She's not going to make the same mistakes."

*Their voice dropped to a gentler register.*

**Aris:** "And she loves you enough to promise. That means something. The music I hear when she talks about this—it's determined, but it's also careful. She knows what she's doing, Cali."

*Calista leaned into Aris's warmth.*

**Calista:** "I know. It's just... fear doesn't listen to logic."

**Aris:** *(tapping a soft rhythm against her shoulder)* "No. It doesn't. But love does. And you love her enough to let her fly—even though it hurts. That's the bravest kind of love there is."

*They began to hum again—this time something gentler, more hopeful. The tune wandered upward, searching for light.*

**Aris:** "She'll be careful. She knows we're always here. And when she comes home—because she *will* come home—we'll celebrate with the biggest feast Lumen has ever seen. I'm already composing the welcome-home song."

*Calista almost smiled.*

**Calista:** "Already?"

**Aris:** "I started it the moment I saw her face tonight. She's going to do amazing things, Cali. And she's going to come back and tell us all about them."

*The bioluminescent gardens pulsed softly, and somewhere in Calista's mind, the dark colors began to shift—just slightly—toward something warmer.*
