## Dialogue with Lyra

*One evening, Lyra brought up an idea that made Calista's heart skip a beat.*

**Lyra:** "Cali, I want to journey around and meet other Astravii communities, learn their stories and experiences. I know it's rare and risky, but I feel like it's something I need to do."

*Calista felt a surge of protective worry. Memories of Joren's tragic death flashed through her mind.*

**Calista:** "Lyra, it's incredibly dangerous. We've already lost someone we loved dearly. I don't want to lose you too."

*Lyra reached out and took her hand, her eyes serious but filled with resolve.*

**Lyra:** "I understand the risks, Cali. But I can't ignore this calling. I'll be careful, and I'll make sure I'm prepared for any challenges."

*Calista took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her fear and Lyra's determination.*

**Calista:** "Promise me you'll take every precaution. And stay in constant communication."

**Lyra:** "I promise."

## Later Conversation with Aris

*Those conversations with Lyra weighed heavily on Calista's mind. One evening, as she stared out into the bioluminescent glow of Lumen, Aris spoke.*

**Aris:** "Cali, Lyra will be alright. She's smart and resourceful, just like you."

**Calista:** "I know. It's just hard not to worry. Losing Joren was so painful, and I can't bear the thought of something happening to her."

*Aris wrapped an arm around her, providing comfort.*

**Aris:** "She'll be careful. And she knows we're always here for her, just like your parents are for you."
