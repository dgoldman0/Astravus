# Grandparent Music with Selene

## Context
Selene teaches Elara to play the harp, just as she once taught Calista the flute. The moment captures the passing of musical tradition across generations.

## Participants
- **Selene** - Grandmother, graceful musician
- **Elara** - Granddaughter, beginning musician

## Dialogue

*On quiet evenings, Selene would play her harp, the delicate notes weaving through the air like a gentle breeze. Elara often sat beside her, captivated by the melodies.*

**Elara:** "Grandma Selene, can you teach me to play?"

*Selene smiled warmly.*

**Selene:** "Of course, my dear. Music is a wonderful way to express yourself and share joy with others. Let's start with something simple."

*She placed Elara's fingers on the strings, guiding her through the first notes of a lullaby.*

**Selene:** "Feel the strings, let them resonate with your touch. Music comes from the heart, not just the hands."

*Elara plucked the strings hesitantly, then with more confidence as Selene encouraged her. The room filled with the sweet, tentative melody of a child discovering the magic of music.*
