## Dialogue

*The café was nestled within Lumen's vibrant marketplace. The air was filled with the scent of freshly brewed tea and the soft murmur of conversations. Cassia arrived with her usual stack of notebooks and a thoughtful expression.*

**Calista:** "It's been too long."

*Cassia grinned, her eyes twinkling with excitement.*

**Cassia:** "It has. I've missed our talks. There's so much to catch up on."

*As they sipped their tea, their conversation flowed effortlessly. Cassia shared her latest ideas—stories exploring the intricate relationships between humans and Astravii, and the ever-expanding universe.*

**Cassia:** "Have you ever wondered what it's like for the Astravii to experience time? How their perception might differ from ours?"

*Calista pondered her question, intrigued.*

**Calista:** "I have. It must be so different, given their immense consciousness and the way they interact with the universe."

**Cassia:** "I've been trying to capture that in my latest story. To imagine what it would be like to live across centuries, to see the rise and fall of civilizations."

*Her words sparked Calista's imagination.*

**Calista:** "That's fascinating. It makes me think about how we perceive our own lives and the impact we have on the world around us."
