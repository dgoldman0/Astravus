# First Meeting with Cassia

## Context
At a community gathering, young Calista encounters Cassia for the first time. Cassia is in the middle of telling a story about a mythical creature, immediately captivating Calista with her storytelling gift. Cassia's communication style is distinctive: her voice has a musical, wonder-filled quality, her eyes sparkle when she speaks, and she draws others into imagination as easily as breathing. This moment marks the beginning of one of Calista's most important childhood friendships.

## Participants
- **Cassia** - New friend, imaginative storyteller with a musical voice
- **Calista** - Young protagonist, drawn in by stories and images

## Setting
*The community gathering hummed with activity—families sharing food, children chasing each other through the gardens, elders telling tales in quiet corners. Calista had wandered away from her parents, exploring the edges of the celebration, when she heard a voice rising above the noise. It wasn't loud, but it was magnetic—musical in a way that made you lean closer.*

## Dialogue

*Cassia sat cross-legged on a blanket, a circle of younger children arranged around her like petals around a flower. Her copper hair caught the light, and her green eyes—bright as new leaves—sparkled with the joy of someone living inside a story rather than just telling one.*

**Cassia:** *(voice rising and falling like song)* "...and the creature had wings made of starlight and eyes that held whole galaxies. When it flew, the sky itself seemed to bow—parting clouds, bending moonbeams, making way for something so beautiful that even the stars stopped to watch..."

*Calista stood at the edge of the circle, transfixed. She could see it—the creature, the bending sky, the reverent stars. The images bloomed behind her eyes as if Cassia were painting with her words.*

*Cassia noticed her and paused mid-sentence, a delighted smile spreading across her face. Without missing a beat, she extended a hand toward Calista, palm up, inviting.*

**Cassia:** *(eyes sparkling)* "You! I can see you're seeing it too. The creature just landed—" 

*She gestured to an empty space beside her.* 

**Cassia:** "—right there. What color are its eyes, do you think?"

*Calista blinked, caught off guard but thrilled.*

**Calista:** *(thinking for a moment, then)* "Purple. Deep purple, like the sky just after sunset. With little flecks of gold, like the first stars coming out."

*Cassia's face lit up with pure delight.*

**Cassia:** "Yes! Exactly! See, everyone? Our new friend knows how to look." 

*She patted the blanket beside her.*

**Cassia:** "Do you want to join our adventure? We're about to find out what the creature is searching for. I have a feeling you'll know."

*Calista settled beside her, heart beating with the strange, immediate certainty that she had found something important. From that moment, something clicked into place—a friendship that would shape both their lives.*

**Calista:** "I'd like that."

**Cassia:** *(leaning close, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper)* "Good. Because the creature? I think it's looking for someone who can paint its story. And I think it just found her."

*The other children giggled, caught up in the magic. Cassia winked at Calista, then raised her voice again, picking up the thread of the tale with even more energy than before.*

**Cassia:** "And so our newest adventurer arrived just in time, for the creature was about to reveal a secret that had been hidden since the stars were young..."
