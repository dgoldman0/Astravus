# First Music Lesson

## Context
An evening in Selene's music room where she introduces young Calista to the flute. This establishes Selene's belief that music speaks directly to the heart.

## Participants
- **Selene** - Musician parent, graceful and encouraging
- **Calista** - Child, initially uncertain but gaining confidence

## Dialogue

**Selene:** "Come sit with me, Cali."

*She patted the seat next to her by the piano.*

**Selene:** "Try playing this melody."

*Calista took a deep breath and began to play. The notes were shaky at first, but Selene's encouraging smile gave her confidence. Gradually, the notes became clearer, blending with the music Selene played.*

**Selene:** "Beautiful. Music speaks to the heart. You just have to listen."
