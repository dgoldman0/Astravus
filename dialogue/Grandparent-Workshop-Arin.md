# Grandparent Workshop with Arin

## Context
Arin continues their hands-on teaching with granddaughter Elara, working on a solar-powered model car project. This echoes Calista's own childhood experiences in Arin's workshop.

## Participants
- **Arin** - Grandparent, skilled engineer and teacher
- **Elara** - Granddaughter, eager learner

## Dialogue

*One weekend, they worked on a project together in his workshop, the space filled with the smell of metal and the hum of machinery.*

**Elara:** "Pass me the wrench, please."

*Arin handed her the tool, watching intently as she worked.*

**Elara:** "What are we building today, Grandpa?"

**Arin:** "We're making a solar-powered model car. It'll teach you how we can use renewable energy to power machines. See these solar panels? They'll collect sunlight and turn it into energy to make the car move."

*Elara's face lit up with excitement.*

**Elara:** "That's amazing! Can I help with the wiring?"

**Arin:** "Of course. Let's do it together. Remember, patience and precision are key."
