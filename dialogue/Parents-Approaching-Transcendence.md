# Parents Approaching Transcendence

## Context
As Calista's parents age and prepare for transcendence, they spend increasing time in connection with Lumen. Calista feels the tension of wanting more time together while respecting their journey.

## Participants
- **Calista's Mother** (Maia) - Approaching transcendence, serene
- **Calista** - Adult daughter, experiencing anticipated loss

## Dialogue

*One afternoon, Calista sat with her mother in the garden, the air filled with the scent of blooming flowers.*

**Calista:** "Mom, I've noticed you and Dad spending more time in your personal spaces. I miss our long talks and shared moments."

*Her mother smiled, her eyes twinkling with a mix of wisdom and serenity.*

**Mother:** "It's part of the journey, Cali. As we prepare for transcendence, we spend more time reflecting and connecting with Lumen. It's not that we want to be away from you, but that we are gradually becoming more integrated with the Astravus."

*Calista felt a pang of sadness but also a profound respect for her mother's acceptance.*

**Calista:** "I'll miss our conversations, your presence. It's hard to imagine life without you here."

*Her mother took her hand, her touch warm and reassuring.*

**Mother:** "I'll always be a part of you, Cali. My love, my lessons, they will remain with you. And remember, transcendence isn't an end but a continuation. We'll be connected through Lumen, in ways we can't fully understand yet."
