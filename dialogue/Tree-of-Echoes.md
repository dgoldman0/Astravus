## Dialogue

*As they pushed through the underbrush, they emerged into a small clearing. In the center stood an ancient tree with gnarled branches and a hollow trunk.*

**Lyra:** "Wow. It looks so old."

**Calista:** "This must be the Tree of Echoes. It was transplanted here when Lumen was founded. The tree was already ancient, grown from a seed gifted by an ancient Astravus. It symbolizes our deep bond and connection to our heritage."

**Kael:** "Let's see if we can hear anything."

*Kael stepped closer to the tree and leaned in, pressing his ear against the trunk. At first, there was silence. Then, faint whispers began to emerge, like distant echoes of voices long past.*

**Lyra:** "This is amazing. It's like the tree is talking to us."

**Calista:** "Let's come back here often."
