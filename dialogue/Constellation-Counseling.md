## Financial Planning Session

**Counselor:** "We'll need to discuss how to manage your finances. It's crucial to ensure stability for your future child."

**Aris:** "We've been careful with our finances, but combining everything and planning for a child is a whole new level."

**Counselor:** "That's why we have these sessions. We'll cover budgeting, savings plans, and resource allocation. It's not just about having enough money but ensuring every decision supports your child's wellbeing and your family's future."

## Emotional Preparation Session

**Counselor:** "Parenthood will test you in ways you haven't experienced before. Open communication and mutual support are crucial."

*Calista squeezed Aris's hand.*

**Calista:** "We've always communicated well, but this will definitely be a new challenge."

## Home Environment Session

**Aris:** "We want our home to be a place of love and creativity. A place where our child can thrive."

**Counselor:** "Creating that environment is essential. Think about spaces for learning, creativity, and relaxation. It's about creating a balance that supports growth and harmony."

**Calista:** "What if we have a room filled with natural light for painting and reading?"

**Aris:** "And a garden where our child can explore and connect with nature. We could have a workshop too, for hands-on learning and projects."

**Counselor:** "Those are wonderful ideas. It's clear you both want to create a nurturing and stimulating environment."

## Practical Skills Session

*One counselor showed them how to swaddle a baby.*

**Counselor:** "Remember, every child is different. Patience and persistence are key."

*Aris struggled with the swaddle and laughed.*

**Aris:** "This is harder than it looks!"

**Counselor:** "Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it."

## Early Education Discussion

**Aris:** "Let's make storytelling a part of our routine."

**Calista:** "Yes, Lyra mentioned how powerful stories are for children. We can create a library corner."
