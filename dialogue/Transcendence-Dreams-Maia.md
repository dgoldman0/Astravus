## Dialogue

*In one dream, Calista wandered through a lush, vibrant garden filled with blooming flowers and the soft hum of life. Maia's warmth enveloped her, her presence a soothing melody. Maia was tending to a bed of flowers, her hands moving with a grace that spoke of centuries of care.*

**Calista:** "Mother."

*The word came unbidden.*

*Maia looked up and smiled, her eyes twinkling with love.*

**Maia:** "Cali, my dear. You've grown so much."

**Calista:** "I miss you."

*Maia continued her work, the leaves rustling gently in the breeze. Calista felt a profound sense of connection, as if the garden itself was part of their shared memory. Maia showed her how to plant a seed, guiding her hands with the same patience and love she had shown when Calista was a child.*
