# User Prompt

Write a side story set in Lumen during the arrival of a visiting Astravus bringing rare trade goods, following a household member navigating the economic web of guilds and households during the excitement. Show the layered currency system—Sparks, Bonds, Rays, and guild scrip—working fluidly. Include cameo appearances by main characters in the background. The story should reveal how Lumen's socioeconomic system creates abundance through circulation rather than accumulation.

# The Arrival Market

## I.

Vesper woke to the resonance.

Deep, harmonic, unfamiliar. A second voice woven into Lumen's usual hum—distant but approaching, like hearing a stranger's song through walls.

She sat up, heart racing with recognition.

Visiting Astravus. Coming to dock.

Corvin was already in the kitchen when she stumbled in, sorting through their trade goods with unusual intensity. "You felt it too?"

"How could I not?" Vesper pulled up the docking schedule on her interface. "Wanderer class. Name is Kestrel. En route from the Outer Reach." She paused, reading. "They're carrying void-grown crystals. And spice blends from the crimson gardens."

Corvin's eyes widened. "The crimson gardens haven't traded in three years."

"I know." Vesper was already calculating. Their household had been saving for something special—Reya's blanket for the baby, yes, but also the tea set repair for Grandmother, and maybe, if they were careful, something rare. Something impossible to get from Lumen alone.

"How much do we have?" she asked.

"☼42 in Rays, ⊤18 in Weaver Threads, and I just got paid ♪30 in Acoustic Notes for last week's consultation."

Vesper did the math. "We need at least ☼100 for the blanket and the tea set. But if Kestrel brought what I think they brought..."

"What are you planning?"

She grinned. "Let's find out what the impossible costs these days."

## II.

The Central Plaza had transformed overnight.

Temporary stalls lined the pathways, draped in bioluminescent banners that shifted colors in patterns Vesper didn't recognize—Kestrel's signature, probably. The air smelled different, carrying hints of foreign gardens and stellar winds. The crowd was three times the normal density, and the energy crackling through it made her skin tingle.

Lumen loved visitors. The whole Astravus practically vibrated with excitement.

Vesper threaded through the crowd, baskets balanced across her shoulders. Her household's spiced honey suddenly felt pedestrian compared to the exotic goods already on display—crystallized starlight in glass vials, fabric woven from some plant that seemed to breathe, instruments that hummed without being touched.

She set up at their usual spot anyway. The honey jars caught the light, familiar and golden.

"Vesper!" Brennan materialized from the chaos, flour-dusted as always, but his eyes were bright with the same fever she felt. "Did you see what they brought?"

"Not yet. I'm selling first, buying later."

"Smart." He gestured at her honey. "I'll take four jars. ☼28, same as always?"

She opened her mouth to agree, then hesitated. The arrival market had different rules. Scarcity and abundance were inverted—common goods became valuable to visitors, rare goods became accessible to residents.

"☼32," she said. "You know the honey won't last, and Kestrel's crew will pay premium for local goods."

Brennan didn't even blink. "Done. And you're right—I should buy eight."

They tapped ledgers. ☼64 transferred clean. She wrapped the jars, already recalculating their household position.

Within an hour, all fourteen jars were gone. ☼156 in new Rays, plus trades she hadn't expected: ◊12 in Kestrel Marks—a temporary currency that would convert to Rays when the visiting Astravus departed—and a promise of three months of bread from Household Brennan, logged but not yet valued.

This was the gift economy revealing itself. Markets amplified what was always there.

## III.

Vesper found the Kestrel delegation's main stall near the eastern arch, where the visiting Astravus had extended a physical connection to Lumen. The interface point glowed with pale blue light, and the stall itself seemed grown rather than built—organic curves that didn't quite match Lumen's aesthetic.

Behind the counter stood a woman with dark skin and silver tattoos that moved. The marks of deep integration, old style.

"What draws your eye?" the woman asked. Her accent was strange, vowels held too long.

Vesper looked at the display. Void-grown crystals that captured and held light. Spices in colors she didn't have names for. And there, half-hidden in the back: a small bundle of seeds, labeled simply "Crimson Garden, Heritage Strain."

Her breath caught.

"The seeds," she said. "What are they?"

"Night-blooming jasmine. The strain our gardens were founded from, before the genetic drift." The woman picked up the bundle carefully. "Kestrel's botanists have been maintaining the pure line for two hundred years. We bring samples when we visit, in case anyone wants to remember what the beginning smelled like."

"How much?"

"☼180, or ☼120 plus guild equivalent."

Vesper checked her ledger. After the morning's sales: ☼198 in Rays, ♪30 in Notes, ⊤18 in Threads, ◊12 in Kestrel Marks. Enough.

But only if she didn't buy the blanket. Didn't repair the tea set. Spent everything on something that might not even grow.

The woman was watching her with patient eyes. "You're calculating what you'll lose to gain this."

"Yes."

"The blanket is for someone you love. The tea set is for someone who's leaving soon." The woman's tattoos shifted, reading something Vesper couldn't see. "And these seeds are for someone who isn't born yet."

Vesper stared. "How did you—"

"The Astravii talk to each other. Kestrel knows what Lumen knows." She smiled. "The choice is still yours."

Vesper closed her eyes. Saw Reya's face when she'd feel the blanket's colors. Saw Grandmother's hands trembling over the repaired tea set. Saw a child she'd never met, decades from now, smelling flowers that had been extinct for centuries.

"I'll take the seeds," she said. "☼120 plus ♪30 in Acoustic Notes."

The woman nodded as if she'd expected this. "The notes work. Kestrel needs soundscape consultation for the eastern gardens—your guild can send someone."

The currencies flowed. The seeds changed hands.

Vesper cradled the bundle, heart pounding with the weight of what she'd chosen.

## IV.

She found the Weavers' stall draped in new work—tapestries that incorporated Kestrel's glowing thread into traditional Lumen patterns. The guildmaster looked up from a partially completed piece.

"Vesper. I have Reya's blanket ready." She produced it: deep blues and greens, hand-woven, perfect. "☼65, or ☼50 plus Threads."

"I can't," Vesper said, the words catching in her throat. "I bought something else. I'm sorry."

The guildmaster's expression shifted—not anger, but curiosity. "Show me."

Vesper unwrapped the seeds.

The guildmaster's breath caught. "Crimson Garden heritage strain." She looked up. "You chose this over the blanket?"

"I don't know if I chose right."

"Neither do I." The guildmaster touched one of the seed pods gently. "But I understand why you chose it." She paused. "Bring me three seeds when they grow. I'll weave their flowers into something for the baby. No charge. That's gift, not trade."

Vesper's eyes stung. "Thank you."

"Go home. Tell Reya. Let her decide if you chose wrong."

On the way back, Vesper passed through the eastern gardens. The crowd had thinned as evening approached, but the excitement still hummed through the air. She spotted familiar faces: a tall man with silver-streaked hair examining Kestrel's musical instruments; a girl with chestnut hair sketching the glowing interface point, black cat watching from her shoulder.

At the ceramics stall, the apprentice was wrapping Grandmother's tea set. Vesper stopped.

"I can't afford it today," she said quietly. "I bought something else instead."

The apprentice looked at the seeds, then at Vesper. "Master Orin says the most important things are the ones we can't afford. Come back next week. We'll work something out."

"But the guild—"

"The guild maintains archives three hundred years old. We can wait one more week." She smiled. "Go home."

## V.

That evening, her household gathered in their central room.

Vesper unwrapped the seeds with trembling hands.

Reya stared at them, then at Vesper. "You bought these instead of my blanket."

"Yes."

"Why?"

Vesper chose her words carefully. "Because the blanket will keep her warm for a few years. But these... if we grow them, if we share them, if they take root in Lumen's gardens—she'll smell them her whole life. Her children will smell them. Everyone will."

Reya's eyes filled with tears. She reached out and touched a seed pod.

"You chose right," she whispered.

Corvin pulled up the household ledger. "Started with ☼42, ⊤18, and ♪30. Sold ☼156 worth of goods. Spent ☼120 on seeds, plus ♪30. Net: ☼78 in Rays, ⊤18 in Threads, ◊12 in Kestrel Marks, plus three months of bread and a promise from the Weavers."

Grandmother was watching Vesper with an expression she couldn't read. "My tea set will wait. But seeds won't." She leaned forward. "Plant them in the morning. I want to see them before I transcend."

Through the window, Lumen's gardens pulsed with doubled light—its own bioluminescence mixed with Kestrel's strange glow. Two Astravii in harmony, two communities trading more than goods.

Trading possibility.

Vesper held the seeds and understood, more clearly than ever, that wealth wasn't what you kept.

It was what you put in motion.

What you chose to grow.
