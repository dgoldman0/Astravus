# User Prompt

Write a side story set in Lumen on market day, following a household member navigating the economic web of guilds and households. Show the layered currency system—Sparks, Bonds, Rays, and guild scrip—working fluidly. Include cameo appearances by main characters in the background. The story should reveal how Lumen's socioeconomic system creates abundance through circulation rather than accumulation.

# Market Morning

Vesper woke to the smell of bread.

Not just any bread—the particular yeast-and-honey scent of Household Brennan's morning loaves, drifting through the shared courtyard that connected their cluster of residences. The smell meant it was Sixthday, which meant market, which meant she had work to do.

She rolled out of bed and padded to the kitchen, where her household-mate Corvin was already sorting their market goods into neat baskets. Preserved fruits in one, dried herbs in another, jars of the spiced honey that had become their household's signature trade item.

"The Weavers confirmed they'll have the blanket ready," Corvin said without looking up. "Reya wants it for the new baby."

Vesper nodded, mentally adjusting her morning route. The Weavers' stall was on the east side of the plaza, which meant she'd pass the Ceramic Artists on the way—she could check on the repair to Grandmother's tea set.

"How are we on Rays?" she asked.

"Forty-two in the household account. Plus we're holding ⊤18 in Weaver Threads from last month." Corvin glanced up. "Should be enough for the blanket if you move the honey well. The ceramics will be maybe ☼12 for materials."

Vesper smiled. She could always move the honey.

The Central Plaza was already humming when she arrived, baskets balanced across her shoulders. Bioluminescent vines draped between the stalls cast everything in soft morning gold, and the Astravus's contentment radiated from the living walls like warmth from a banked fire.

Lumen loved market days. Vesper could feel it in the slightly sweeter air, the way the pathways seemed to guide foot traffic into pleasant eddies rather than frustrating jams.

She set up at their household's usual spot—a stone table that had been their grandmother's grandmother's, worn smooth by generations of trade. The jars caught the light. She waited.

"Vesper!" A voice cut through the crowd. "Is that the mountain honey?"

She looked up to see Brennan himself—broad-shouldered, flour-dusted, carrying a basket of the bread that had woken her. Behind him trailed two of his household's children, already browsing a fruit seller three stalls down.

"Last batch of the season," Vesper said. "The bees are sleeping."

Brennan's eyes widened. "I need four jars. Name your price."

"☼28 for four." A slight premium for end-of-season scarcity.

Brennan didn't even hesitate. He tapped his ledger against hers, and the Rays transferred—his household account to hers, clean and immediate. "Worth every ray. The festival cakes won't be the same without it."

Vesper wrapped the jars carefully and handed them over. No negotiation, no calculating relative worth, no awkwardness. Just a fair price paid in currency they both trusted.

The morning flowed like water finding its level.

A young acoustic architect stopped by, examining the dried herbs. "Scent-dampening sage? I'm setting up a new studio."

"☼6 for the bundle. Or—" Vesper checked her ledger. "We're actually looking to accumulate some Notes. ♪15 would work too."

He brightened. "♪15 is easier for me right now. I'm flush with guild scrip, short on Rays until my first clients pay."

They tapped ledgers. Vesper's household now held ♪15 in Acoustic Notes—good at any guild workshop for soundscape consultations. Her household-mate Reya would love that; she'd been complaining about the echo in the nursery.

A neighboring household sent their eldest with ☼14 and a question: could they reserve eight hours of care next month? Vesper checked the household schedule. Grandmother was eager for more time with little ones before her transcendence.

"☼14 covers six hours at standard rate," Vesper said. "But tell your parents we'll do eight. Grandmother loves your little ones." She marked the care commitment in their ledger—partly paid, partly gift.

By mid-morning, half her goods were gone and the household account had grown: ☼28 from Brennan, ☼14 from the neighbors, ☼18 from smaller sales. Plus ♪15 in Notes. This was the real wealth of Lumen—not hoarded savings but active flow, currencies moving through you like breath.

She found the Weavers' stall draped in new work—tapestries that shimmered with thread spun from some plant she didn't recognize. Behind the display, Vesper glimpsed the guild's workshop through an open arch: rows of looms working in gentle rhythm, tended by the Astravus's automated systems, producing everyday cloth while the guild's members focused on the pieces that required human hands.

The guildmaster, a woman with silver hair and fingers perpetually stained with dye, looked up as Vesper approached. She'd been sketching a new pattern—the kind of work no loom could do on its own.

"The blanket's ready. Reya's colors, as promised." She produced it from beneath the counter: deep blues and greens that seemed to hold their own light. Hand-woven, Vesper noted—a ceremonial piece, not something from the automated lines. "☼65, or ☼50 plus Threads."

Vesper checked her ledger. The household now held ☼102 in Rays and ⊤18 in Weaver Threads.

"☼47 plus our ⊤18?"

"Done." The guildmaster tapped her own ledger, and the currencies flowed—Rays to the guild's general account, Threads back into guild circulation where they'd eventually reach another member or convert to Rays for external purchases.

The blanket changed hands. Vesper cradled it carefully, already imagining Reya's face.

The plaza had grown crowded by the time she reached the Ceramic Artists' corner. She spotted familiar faces in the throng—a tall man with silver-streaked hair telling a story to a cluster of children (was that the oral historian from Calista's constellation? Dorian, she thought his name was); a petite woman with white hair examining a display of wind chimes, fingers twitching as if scoring the sounds they made.

At the ceramics stall, a young apprentice was carefully wrapping her grandmother's tea set—the crack in the teapot lid now invisibly mended, the glaze refreshed to its original soft gray. Behind her, the guild's fabricators hummed quietly, producing standard bowls and cups from established patterns. But restoration work like this—reading the old glaze, matching the original maker's intent—that was irreducibly human.

"That's beautiful work," Vesper said.

The apprentice ducked her head, pleased. "Master Orin showed me a technique from the archives. Three hundred years old, but perfect for this glaze. The fabricators can make a thousand cups, but they can't do *this*." She touched the mended lid with evident pride.

"What's the damage?"

"☼8 for materials. The labor was logged as training hours."

Vesper paid, then paused. She still had several jars of honey. "Would you take a jar as a gift? For your household, from ours."

The apprentice's smile was worth more than any currency. But that was the point—gifts flowed outside the currency system, building relationships that made the currencies work.

---

On her way home, Vesper passed through the eastern gardens. The paths here wound between food-bearing plants and pure ornamentals, the Astravus's way of reminding everyone that beauty was as necessary as bread.

A girl sat on a bench, sketchbook in lap, black cat curled beside her. The girl's chestnut waves caught the bioluminescent light as she drew, utterly absorbed. Her cat watched Vesper with knowing green eyes, then returned to its nap.

Vesper walked on, smiling.

That evening, her household gathered in their central room.

Grandmother examined the repaired tea set with trembling hands, then looked up with wet eyes. "Your grandfather gave me this before his transcendence. I thought I'd lost it forever when it cracked."

"The guild kept the old techniques," Vesper said. "They're still there when we need them."

Reya held the blanket against her growing belly, the colors shimmering. "It's perfect. The baby will know these colors before she even opens her eyes."

Corvin tallied the day in the household ledger. "Started with ☼42 and ⊤18. Sold ☼60 worth of goods. Spent ☼55 on the blanket and ☼8 on ceramics. Net: ☼39 in Rays, ♪15 in Notes, and six paid care hours committed for next month." He looked up. "Plus three jars of honey given as gifts."

"Gifts don't go in the ledger," Grandmother said, her voice gentle.

"I know." Corvin smiled. "But I like to remember them anyway."

In the corner, the household's small fabricator hummed through its evening queue—standard jars for tomorrow's honey, replacement lids for the preserve containers, the small necessities that no one needed to make by hand. It freed them to do what mattered: the spice blend that made their honey unique, the careful harvesting that kept the bees content, the relationships that turned neighbors into customers and customers into friends.

Through the window, Lumen's bioluminescent gardens shifted toward evening colors. The Astravus hummed, low and satisfied—the sound of a living world where currencies flowed like blood and gifts flowed like breath.

Vesper understood, as she always did on market days, that she wasn't just trading goods.

She was weaving Lumen together, one transaction at a time.
