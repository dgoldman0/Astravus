# The Mending Hour

Orin was halfway through a fermented tea—his third of the morning—when the summons arrived.

Not a message. A pulse. The kind that bypassed language entirely and landed in the body: *urgent, pediatric, structural trauma, eastern terrace gardens.*

He set the cup down without looking and was moving before the pulse finished. His kit was already on his shoulder; he slept with it nearby. Old habit from training years, never broken.

The eastern terraces were six minutes away on foot. Orin made it in four.

A small crowd had gathered at the base of one of the climbing structures—a lattice of interwoven vines and organic supports that children scaled for play. Now it looked wrong, several strands hanging loose, and on the mossy ground beneath lay a child, maybe eight years old, with a man and woman crouched over her.

"Biomedical," Orin announced, pushing gently through. "I need space."

The crowd parted. The parents looked up with the hollow, desperate expression he had seen too many times.

"She was climbing," the father said, voice cracked. "The vine—it gave way—she fell—"

"How far?"

"Four meters. Maybe five."

Orin knelt beside the girl. Her name came through his Core link a moment later—Vela, eight years old, household Tessin, no prior medical events. She was conscious but pale, breathing shallowly, and her left arm bent at an angle that made his stomach clench.

"Vela," he said calmly. "I'm Orin. I'm going to help you."

Her eyes found his. Tears leaked from the corners. "It hurts."

"I know. I'm going to make it stop." He pressed his palm to the moss beside her and opened his awareness to the Astravus. *I need support here. Dampen her pain pathways. Stabilize her spine until I can assess.*

The response came immediately—a subtle warmth spreading through the ground beneath Vela, the bioluminescent moss brightening slightly as the Astravus diverted resources. Orin felt the shift: the girl's breathing eased, her face relaxing as the pain receded.

"Better?" he asked.

"A little." Her voice was small but steadier.

Orin ran his hands just above her body, not quite touching, letting the diagnostic nanites in his fingertips read the damage. Compound fracture of the left humerus—bad but fixable. Three cracked ribs, right side. Bruised organs but no rupture. The spine was intact. No cranial trauma, though she'd struck her head on the moss. The Astravus had cushioned her. It always tried.

"She's stable," Orin said to the parents. "Significant but not life-threatening. I need to set the arm and seal the ribs before we move her."

The mother's hand flew to her mouth. The father gripped her shoulder.

"Can we stay?" he asked.

"Yes. Talk to her. Keep her calm."

Orin unfolded his kit—not the sterile gleaming instruments of old Earth medicine, but a set of living tools nested in a soft organic case. A bone guide, grown from a culture maintained by the Biomedical Practitioners for centuries. A tissue mender, its surface rippling slightly as it sensed the nearby injury. A pain blocker, though the Astravus was already handling most of that.

"Vela, I'm going to fix your arm now," he said. "You won't feel much. Your parents are right here."

"Okay." She reached for her mother's hand with her good arm.

Orin worked quickly but carefully. The bone guide slid beneath the fracture, its tendrils weaving through muscle and tissue with a precision no human hand could match. He felt it lock onto the bone fragments and begin realignment—a slow, grinding sensation that Vela couldn't feel but he could, transmitted through his interface.

"Tell me about something you like," Orin said, keeping her focus away from the procedure. "Do you have any pets?"

"A rabbit," Vela said. "His name is Bounce. He hops everywhere."

"Does he sleep in your room?"

"Sometimes. Mama says he shouldn't but Papa lets him."

The father managed a weak smile.

The bone guide clicked—the sound of proper alignment. Orin applied the tissue mender next, letting it seal the break with a biological adhesive that would be absorbed as the bone healed. Three weeks in a growth sleeve and she'd be climbing again, if she wanted.

The ribs were easier. He placed the mender against her side and let it work, sealing the cracks with the same patient precision. Throughout, he felt the Astravus beneath them both, supporting, monitoring, adjusting. It knew every cell in Vela's body the same way it knew every cell in its own.

*Thank you,* he thought.

The Astravus responded with something that felt like gentle acknowledgment. *She is ours.*

"Done," Orin said, sitting back. "She'll need to rest, and I'll want to see her at the guild hall tomorrow for follow-up. But she's going to be fine."

The mother began to cry—relief, not grief. The father pulled Vela carefully into his arms, cradling her good side.

"Thank you," he said. "Thank you. We didn't know if—"

"The fall was bad," Orin admitted. "But she's strong. And she landed well." He didn't add *the Astravus caught her*, but they probably knew.

A Lattice Technician arrived then—a young woman with a troubled expression. She glanced at the damaged climbing structure and then at Orin.

"I felt it give," she said quietly. "The support vine. It was stressed. I should have—"

"You can't check everything," Orin said. "Fix it now. That's what matters."

She nodded and went to work, placing her hands against the damaged lattice, beginning the slow process of rebalancing.

Orin helped the family carry Vela toward their household, the father bearing her while the mother walked alongside, stroking her hair. The girl was already drowsing, the combination of shock and the Astravus's pain suppression pulling her toward sleep.

At their threshold, the mother turned back.

"How do we—" She hesitated. "The cost. The guild. We want to—"

Orin shook his head. "It's covered. Always."

This was the part outsiders never understood. The Biomedical Practitioners didn't charge for emergencies. Not in Rays, not in scrip, not in favors. The guild's reserves existed for exactly this: moments when someone fell and needed catching. Later, if the family wanted, they could contribute—most did, eventually—but there was no ledger, no debt, no obligation.

"Rest," Orin said. "All of you. I'll see her tomorrow."

He walked back through the terraces as the morning brightened, the bioluminescent pathways shifting to daytime mode. The climbing structure was already half-repaired, the Lattice Technician working in silent concentration. By afternoon, children would be scaling it again.

Orin stopped at a garden bench and sat for a moment, letting his heartbeat settle.

The summons had arrived at 0714. By 0738, Vela was stabilized and going home. Twenty-four minutes from injury to resolution.

And yet it never felt fast enough.

He pulled out his tea—the fermented blend from the Collective, now cold—and drank it anyway. The familiar bitterness grounded him.

On the path nearby, a pair of children ran past, laughing at some private joke. They didn't notice him. They didn't need to. That was the point. The Biomedical Practitioners worked so that life could continue uninterrupted, so that a morning's accident became an afternoon's story and eventually a faded memory.

Orin finished his tea, tucked the cup away, and headed toward the guild hall.

There was always more work to do.
