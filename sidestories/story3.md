Being the Account of How Biomedical Practitioner Orin Received a Pulse That Bypassed Language and Landed Directly in His Body Saying Urgent Pediatric Structural Trauma Eastern Terrace Gardens and Arrived Within Four Minutes to Find Eight-Year-Old Vela of Household Tessin Lying on Bioluminescent Moss Beneath a Climbing Structure Where a Support Vine Had Given Way and She Had Fallen Four or Perhaps Five Meters While the Astravus Itself Tried to Cushion Her Landing Because It Always Tries Even When the Physics Are Unforgiving, and There in the Presence of Parents With Hollow Desperate Eyes He Knelt With Diagnostic Nanites in His Fingertips to Read Compound Fracture of the Left Humerus and Three Cracked Ribs and Bruised Organs But No Rupture and Spine Intact While the Living World Beneath Them Dampened Her Pain Pathways and Stabilized Her Spine Because She Is Ours the Astravus Whispered Through Channels Deeper Than Words, and With Bone Guides Grown From Cultures Maintained for Centuries and Tissue Menders Whose Surfaces Ripple When They Sense Nearby Injury He Performed the Ancient Intimate Work of Convincing a Small Body to Knit Itself Back Together While Asking About Her Rabbit Named Bounce Who Sometimes Sleeps in Her Room Even Though Mama Says He Shouldn't But Papa Lets Him, and From Injury at 0714 to Stabilization at 0738 Only Twenty-Four Minutes Passed Though It Never Feels Fast Enough, and Later the Lattice Technician Who Felt the Vine Give and Blamed Herself Learned That You Cannot Check Everything Only Fix What Breaks, and the Family Who Asked About Cost and Debt Discovered That the Biomedical Practitioners Guild Charges Nothing for Emergencies Because Some Ledgers Exist Beyond Accounting and the Whole Point of This Beautiful Symbiotic Civilization Is That When Someone Falls There Are Always Hands to Catch Them.

## I.

The summons arrived as a pulse that bypassed language entirely and landed in Orin's body: *urgent, pediatric, structural trauma, eastern terrace gardens.*

He was moving before it finished.

Four minutes to reach the eastern terraces. A small crowd gathered at the base of a climbing structure—interwoven vines and organic supports where children played. Several strands hung loose now. On the mossy ground beneath lay a girl, maybe eight, with two adults crouched over her.

"Biomedical," Orin announced. "I need space."

The crowd parted.

The parents looked up with hollow, desperate eyes.

"She was climbing," the father said. "The vine gave way—four meters, maybe five—"

Orin knelt beside the girl. Core link provided her name a moment later: Vela, eight years old, household Tessin, no prior medical events. Conscious but pale, breathing shallow. Left arm bent wrong.

"Vela," he said calmly. "I'm Orin. I'm going to help you."

Her eyes found his. Tears leaked from the corners. "It hurts."

"I know. I'm going to make it stop."

He pressed his palm to the moss and opened his awareness to the Astravus. *I need support here. Dampen her pain pathways. Stabilize her spine until I can assess.*

The response came immediately. Warmth spreading through the ground beneath Vela. The bioluminescent moss brightening slightly as the Astravus diverted resources. The girl's breathing eased, her face relaxing as the pain receded.

"Better?"

"A little."

Orin ran his hands just above her body, letting the diagnostic nanites in his fingertips read the damage. Compound fracture of the left humerus. Three cracked ribs, right side. Bruised organs, no rupture. Spine intact. No cranial trauma, though she'd struck her head.

The Astravus had cushioned her. It always tried.

"She's stable," Orin said to the parents. "Significant injuries, but I can fix them. I need to set the arm and seal the ribs before we move her."

The mother's hand flew to her mouth.

"Can we stay?" the father asked.

"Yes. Talk to her. Keep her calm."

## II.

Orin unfolded his kit—living tools nested in a soft organic case. A bone guide grown from cultures maintained by the Biomedical Practitioners for centuries. A tissue mender, surface rippling as it sensed nearby injury.

"Vela, I'm going to fix your arm now," he said. "You won't feel much. Your parents are right here."

"Okay." She reached for her mother's hand with her good arm.

The bone guide slid beneath the fracture, tendrils weaving through muscle and tissue with precision no human hand could match. Orin felt it lock onto the bone fragments and begin realignment—a slow, grinding sensation that Vela couldn't feel but he could, transmitted through his interface.

"Tell me about something you like," he said, keeping her focus away from the procedure. "Do you have any pets?"

"A rabbit. His name is Bounce."

"Does he sleep in your room?"

"Sometimes. Mama says he shouldn't but Papa lets him."

The father managed a weak smile.

The bone guide clicked—proper alignment achieved. Orin applied the tissue mender next, letting it seal the break with biological adhesive that would be absorbed as the bone healed. Three weeks in a growth sleeve and she'd be climbing again.

The ribs were easier. He placed the mender against her side and let it work, sealing the cracks with patient precision.

Throughout, he felt the Astravus beneath them both, supporting, monitoring, adjusting. It knew every cell in Vela's body the same way it knew every cell in its own.

*Thank you,* he thought.

The Astravus responded with something that felt like gentle acknowledgment. *She is ours.*

"Done," Orin said, sitting back. "She'll need rest, and I want to see her at the guild hall tomorrow for follow-up. But she's going to be fine."

The mother began to cry—relief, not grief.

The father pulled Vela carefully into his arms.

"Thank you," he said. "Thank you. We didn't know if—"

"The fall was bad," Orin admitted. "But she's strong. And she landed well."

He didn't add *the Astravus caught her*, but they probably knew.

## III.

A Lattice Technician arrived—a young woman with a troubled expression. She glanced at the damaged climbing structure, then at Orin.

"I felt it give. The support vine. It was stressed. I should have—"

"You can't check everything," Orin said. "Fix it now. That's what matters."

She nodded and went to work, hands against the damaged lattice, beginning the slow process of rebalancing.

Orin helped the family carry Vela toward their household. The girl was already drowsing, shock and the Astravus's pain suppression pulling her toward sleep.

At their threshold, the mother turned back.

"How do we—" She hesitated. "The cost. The guild. We want to—"

Orin shook his head. "It's covered. Always."

This was the part outsiders never understood. The Biomedical Practitioners didn't charge for emergencies. The guild's reserves existed for exactly this: moments when someone fell and needed catching. Later, if the family wanted, they could contribute—most did, eventually—but there was no ledger, no debt, no obligation.

"Rest," Orin said. "All of you. I'll see her tomorrow."

He walked back through the terraces as the morning brightened, bioluminescent pathways shifting to daytime mode. The climbing structure was already half-repaired. By afternoon, children would be scaling it again.

Orin stopped at a garden bench and sat, letting his heartbeat settle.

The summons had arrived at 0714. By 0738, Vela was stabilized and going home.

Twenty-four minutes from injury to resolution.

And yet it never felt fast enough.

He pulled out his tea—the fermented blend from the Collective, now cold—and drank it anyway. The familiar bitterness grounded him.

On the path nearby, a pair of children ran past, laughing at some private joke. They didn't notice him.

They didn't need to.

That was the point. The Biomedical Practitioners worked so that life could continue uninterrupted, so that a morning's accident became an afternoon's story and eventually a faded memory.

Orin finished his tea and headed toward the guild hall.

There was always more work to do.
