# User Prompt

Write a side story set in Lumen featuring a lattice technician doing maintenance work during the quiet hours of early morning. Include a chance encounter with a certain young girl and her black cat familiar (Calista and Shadow) who can sense the Astravus's undertones. The story should show the technician working with the Tree of Echoes to help process grief from the community, then finding peace watching the Festival of Lights, observing familiar faces and reflecting on the quiet, essential work of maintaining the living world they inhabit.

# The Lattice Work

## I.

The bioluminescent pathways were doing that thing again—the slow dimming that wasn't quite sleep, not quite waking. Tamsin pressed her palm against the corridor wall and felt it shift beneath her touch, adjusting temperature by half a degree.

"Good morning," she murmured.

The wall warmed in response.

She'd been a lattice technician for nine years. Long enough to recognize fatigue in living architecture. Long enough to know when the Astravus was compensating for stress it shouldn't have to carry alone.

The eastern corridor had been singing wrong for three days—not loudly enough for residents to notice, but there. A hesitation in the resonance. Like someone trying to remember a word and finding only the shape of it.

Tamsin adjusted her interface band and placed both hands flat against the wall. The feedback came immediately: pressure distribution asymmetric, support vine cluster seven overloaded, backup systems engaged when they should be resting.

"You've been carrying too much," she said.

The corridor shimmered, almost embarrassed.

She smiled and began the work. Redirecting nutrient flow. Coaxing the eastern support cluster to share load with the underutilized western network. Encouraging new growth where old pathways had stiffened. It was like massage and surgery and negotiation all at once.

Footsteps echoed at the far end of the hall.

"Oh—sorry! I thought this section was empty."

Tamsin glanced up. A girl stood frozen mid-step, maybe twelve, chestnut hair hastily tied back, eyes too bright for someone who should still be asleep. A black cat sat beside her, tail curled neatly over its paws.

"It's fine," Tamsin said. "Just don't touch anything while I'm working."

The girl immediately clasped her hands behind her back. The cat, naturally, ignored this entirely and padded forward to inspect Tamsin with luminous green eyes.

"Shadow," the girl hissed. "Leave her alone."

"She's fine." Tamsin returned her attention to the wall. "Most people can't feel when I'm working. You can, can't you?"

The girl hesitated. "My sibling says I imagine it."

"You don't." Tamsin made a final adjustment and felt the corridor sigh with relief. "You just don't have the vocabulary yet."

She stepped back. The hum had smoothed out, the walls realigning subtly. The space felt... lighter.

The girl was watching her with an expression Tamsin recognized. Curiosity wrestling with caution. The look of someone who understood more than they could articulate.

"Thank you for waiting," Tamsin said.

The girl grinned and darted off, Shadow flowing after her like living ink.

Tamsin listened to the footsteps fade, then checked her list.

The Tree of Echoes was next.

## II.

She felt it before she reached the clearing. A low resonance that touched the edges of thought—layered, complex, unsettled.

The Tree of Echoes was restless.

Tamsin circled the massive trunk, boots sinking into moss that pulsed with faint bioluminescence. The tree was older than most Astraviin alive today. Its roots threaded through memory-rich strata, touching moments from Lumen's earliest migrations. Birth. Bonding. First words spoken in rooms that no longer existed.

And grief.

The tree remembered grief the way water remembered motion—taking shape from what passed through it.

Someone had been here recently. Small footprints tracked through the moss. A sketch pinned to the bark with a biodegradable clasp: three stick figures beneath oversized stars, colors bright enough to hurt.

Tamsin touched the drawing gently.

"Still teaching them," she said.

The tree responded with a creak—less sound than presence.

She placed both palms against the bark and opened her senses. The imbalance was immediate. Too much accumulated resonance, too many echoes without space to soften. A community that rarely lost anyone didn't develop good habits around letting go.

The work required care. She couldn't just erase the grief—that would dishonor it. Instead, she coaxed it outward, dispersing the sharpest edges into the surrounding lattice where they could mingle with other memories, becoming part of the background hum instead of a constant ache.

By the time she finished, her eyes were stinging and her breath came shallow.

She sat at the base of the tree and let herself be small for a while.

Voices drifted past on the nearby path. A storyteller's cadence, measured and warm, followed by the shuffle of children's footsteps.

"…not just what happened," the storyteller was saying, "but how it felt. That's what we remember."

One of the children lingered at the edge of the clearing, staring at the tree. Their expression was thoughtful, old beyond their years. Then they turned and hurried after the group.

Tamsin waited until the voices faded completely before standing.

"Thank you," she told the tree.

It responded with warmth deeper than temperature.

## III.

The Festival of Lights began at dusk.

Tamsin wasn't on duty, but she wandered the plaza anyway. Lanterns rose into the upper reaches of Lumen's canopy, each carrying something private—wishes, memories, hopes too fragile to speak aloud. Music layered through the crowd, organic and improvised.

She stood at the plaza's edge and watched people she barely knew celebrate with people they loved fiercely.

A laugh cut through the music—bright, musical, infectious. A young woman was gesturing wildly at her companion, hands shaping invisible concepts, metaphors tumbling over each other faster than words could contain them. Her companion watched with the expression of someone who'd learned to translate enthusiasm into patience.

Near the fountain, the girl from the corridor sat cross-legged with two older siblings, sketching the lanterns as they rose. The black cat sprawled beside her, utterly unimpressed by the spectacle.

Tamsin smiled.

This was the work.

Not the grand transformations or elegant theories. Not transcendence or legacy or even memory, really.

Just maintenance.

Noticing strain before it became fracture. Making room for grief without letting it calcify. Ensuring that when people moved forward, the world moved with them.

Someone bumped into her—apologized—disappeared into the crowd.

A lantern drifted past her face, close enough to feel its warmth.

Above, Lumen's bioluminescent ceiling pulsed in rhythm with the music, the Astravus participating in the only way it could. Tamsin felt the familiar hum beneath everything, steady and patient.

There was always more work to do.

The lattice never finished rebalancing. The Tree of Echoes would collect more grief. The corridors would develop new hesitations, new patterns of wear.

And Tamsin would be there in the quiet hours, hands against living walls, listening for the things most people couldn't hear.

She turned away from the festival and headed back toward the eastern sector.

Someone would need her there tomorrow.

And that was exactly how Lumen stayed whole.
