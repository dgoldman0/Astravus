# User Prompt

Write a side story set in Lumen featuring a lattice technician doing maintenance work during the quiet hours of early morning. Include a chance encounter with a certain young girl and her black cat familiar (Calista and Shadow) who can sense the Astravus's undertones. The story should show the technician working with the Tree of Echoes to help process grief from the community, then finding peace watching the Festival of Lights, observing familiar faces and reflecting on the quiet, essential work of maintaining the living world they inhabit.

# The Lattice Work

Tamsin liked to work during the hour when Lumen was neither fully awake nor fully asleep.

The bioluminescent pathways dimmed themselves in stages then, the gardens shifting color like a slow breath. The Astravus adjusted pressure, temperature, and light with the patience of something that had all the time in the universe. Most Astraviin were still dreaming—those not yet deeply merged always dreamed more vividly—and the plazas were empty except for drifting pollen and the soft hum beneath everything.

Tamsin preferred that hum to voices.

She was a lattice technician, which meant her job sat at the intersection of biology, architecture, and intuition. The lattice wasn’t something most people saw: a web of living support structures woven through Lumen’s bones, guiding growth, distributing strain, translating the Astravus’s needs into physical form. If a bridge sang when it shouldn’t, if a garden leaned too far toward one spectrum of light, if a hallway began remembering the wrong footsteps—it was the lattice that needed attention.

Tamsin carried no visible tools. She wore a slim interface band at her wrist and trusted her hands, her senses, and the Astravus itself.

“This won’t take long,” she murmured, pressing her palm to the inner wall of a corridor near the eastern gardens.

The wall warmed in greeting.

She felt it immediately: a subtle hesitation in the flow, like a thought half-finished. Fatigue.

“You’ve been carrying too much,” Tamsin said gently.

The corridor responded with a faint shimmer, embarrassed.

She smiled and began the slow work of rebalancing—redirecting growth, easing pressure, encouraging a nearby support vine to take on more structural responsibility. It was like convincing a stubborn muscle to relax.

A pair of footsteps echoed at the far end of the hall. Light, quick, familiar.

“Sorry!” a voice whispered much louder than necessary. “I thought this way was empty.”

Tamsin glanced up as a girl about twelve skidded to a stop, chestnut waves pulled back hastily, deep blue eyes bright with the kind of curiosity that rarely slept. A sleek black cat paused beside her, tail flicking.

The girl froze. “I can wait.”

“You don’t have to,” Tamsin said. “Just don’t touch anything.”

The girl nodded solemnly, immediately resting her hands behind her back. The cat, of course, ignored this entirely and padded closer, inspecting Tamsin with luminous green eyes.

“Well,” Tamsin said to the cat, “at least one of you listens.”

The girl stifled a laugh. “Shadow does what she wants.”

“Of course she does.”

They shared a quiet moment while the corridor settled. Tamsin finished her adjustments, the hum smoothing out, the walls subtly realigning.

“There,” she said, stepping back. “All better.”

The girl tilted her head, as if listening to something only half audible. “It feels… calmer.”

Tamsin studied her more closely now. “You hear the undertones.”

“Sometimes,” the girl said. “My sibling says I imagine it.”

“You don’t,” Tamsin replied. “You just haven’t learned the words yet.”

That earned her a grin before the girl darted off again, Shadow slipping after her like a shadow that knew its name.

Tamsin watched them disappear, then turned toward her next destination.

The Tree of Echoes was restless.

She felt it before she reached the clearing—a low, layered resonance rippling outward, brushing against her thoughts like an unfinished chord. The tree was ancient even by Astravus standards, its roots threaded deep into memory-dense strata. It remembered migrations, first bonds, the early harmonics of Lumen itself.

It also remembered grief.

Tamsin circled the trunk slowly, boots sinking into moss that glowed faintly under her steps. Someone had been here recently. Small footprints. The lingering warmth of young bodies. A sketch pinned gently into the bark with a biodegradable clasp—crude lines, bright colors, three figures standing beneath exaggerated stars.

“Still teaching them to listen,” Tamsin murmured.

The tree answered with a soft creak—more presence than sound.

“I know,” she said. “It hurts. It’s supposed to.”

She placed both hands against the bark and opened herself just enough to feel the imbalance. Accumulation. Too many echoes layered without space to fade. A community that rarely lost anyone didn’t have good habits around letting go.

Tamsin worked slowly, coaxing excess resonance outward, dispersing it into the surrounding lattice where it could soften, mingle, become something shared instead of sharp. The process left her breathless, eyes stinging.

When she finished, she sat at the base of the tree and let herself feel small.

Voices drifted from the path beyond the clearing. Adults this time. Measured footsteps. A low, familiar cadence of storytelling.

“…not just what happened,” the voice was saying, “but how it felt to be there. That’s what matters.”

Tamsin didn’t turn around. She didn’t need to.

The storyteller passed without noticing her, followed by a handful of children. One lingered, glancing toward the tree, expression thoughtful, then hurried after the group.

Tamsin waited until they were gone before standing.

“Thank you,” she told the Tree.

It responded with a warmth deeper than temperature.

Later that evening, the Festival of Lights bloomed across Lumen.

Tamsin wasn’t officially on duty, but she wandered the plaza anyway, drawn by habit more than obligation. Lanterns drifted upward like captive stars, each carrying a wish, a memory, a hope too personal to say aloud. Music wove through the crowd, layered and living.

She paused near the edge of the plaza, watching people she barely knew dance with people they loved fiercely.

A familiar laugh cut through the noise—bright, musical. A young woman was animatedly describing something to a companion, hands moving like she was shaping the air itself. Tamsin caught fragments of story, metaphor stacked on metaphor, a mind that saw worlds everywhere.

Nearby, the girl from the corridor sat cross-legged with her siblings, sketching the lanterns as they rose. The cat sprawled beside her, unimpressed by the spectacle.

Tamsin smiled.

This, she thought, was the quiet work of constellations.

Not the grand designs or the elegant theories. Not transcendence or legacy or even memory.

But maintenance.

The constant, humble act of noticing strain before it became fracture. Of making room for grief without letting it calcify. Of ensuring that when people moved forward, the world moved with them.

As the lanterns vanished into the upper glow and the Astravus hummed its approval, Tamsin turned back toward the lattice, already feeling where she’d be needed next.

There was always more quiet work to do.

And that was exactly how Lumen stayed whole.
