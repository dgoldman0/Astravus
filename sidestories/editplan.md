# Edit Plan: Stylistic Revisions for Side Stories

## Issue Summary

The stories contain a pattern of "not X, but Y" constructions and similar negative framings that:
1. Tell the reader what something ISN'T when they don't need to know
2. State something "is the case" rather than simply showing it through detail
3. Waste words on negations when positive description would be stronger

**Exception:** When the negation expresses surprise, dismay, or contrast that matters to the narrative (e.g., "Except it wasn't a star" — this works because it conveys the character's shock).
