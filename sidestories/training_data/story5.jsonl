Their civilization stands at a crossroads: technologically advancing but politically fractured, gazing upward with equal measures of hope and fear. Their astronomers detect a massive living structure in solar orbit—an Astravus, city-sized at forty kilometers across, drawing energy from the star's corona. The encounter is accidental; the Astravus came to refuel due to an emergency. Follow multiple perspectives as the discovery unfolds: scientists racing to understand, leaders struggling to control, ordinary people confronting the impossible. When the Astraviin aboard realize they've been detected, they face a choice: depart quietly or make first contact. Unknown to the Verathi, these visitors are far-future descendants of humanity, carrying memories of a world called Earth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}]}
