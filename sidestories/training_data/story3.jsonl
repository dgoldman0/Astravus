A small crowd gathered at the base of a climbing structure—interwoven vines and organic supports where children played. Several strands hung loose now. On the mossy ground beneath lay a girl, maybe eight, with two adults crouched over her.\n\n\"Biomedical,\" Orin announced. \"I need space.\"\n\nThe crowd parted.\n\nThe parents looked up with hollow, desperate eyes.\n\n\"She was climbing,\" the father said. \"The vine gave way—four meters, maybe five—\"\n\nOrin knelt beside the girl. Core link provided her name a moment later: Vela, eight years old, household Tessin, no prior medical events. Conscious but pale, breathing shallow. Left arm bent wrong.\n\n\"Vela,\" he said calmly. \"I'm Orin. I'm going to help you.\"\n\nHer eyes found his. Tears leaked from the corners. \"It hurts.\"\n\n\"I know. I'm going to make it stop.\"\n\nHe pressed his palm to the moss and opened his awareness to the Astravus. *I need support here. Dampen her pain pathways. Stabilize her spine until I can assess.*\n\nThe response came immediately. Warmth spreading through the ground beneath Vela. The bioluminescent moss brightening slightly as the Astravus diverted resources. The girl's breathing eased, her face relaxing as the pain receded.\n\n\"Better?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\nOrin ran his hands just above her body, letting the diagnostic nanites in his fingertips read the damage. Compound fracture of the left humerus. Three cracked ribs, right side. Bruised organs, no rupture. Spine intact. No cranial trauma, though she'd struck her head.\n\nThe Astravus had cushioned her. It always tried.\n\n\"She's stable,\" Orin said to the parents. \"Significant injuries, but I can fix them. I need to set the arm and seal the ribs before we move her.\"\n\nThe mother's hand flew to her mouth.\n\n\"Can we stay?\" the father asked.\n\n\"Yes. Talk to her. Keep her calm.\"\n\n---\n\n## II.\n\nOrin unfolded his kit—living tools nested in a soft organic case. A bone guide grown from cultures maintained by the Biomedical Practitioners for centuries. A tissue mender, surface rippling as it sensed nearby injury.\n\n\"Vela, I'm going to fix your arm now,\" he said. \"You won't feel much. Your parents are right here.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" She reached for her mother's hand with her good arm.\n\nThe bone guide slid beneath the fracture, tendrils weaving through muscle and tissue with precision no human hand could match. Orin felt it lock onto the bone fragments and begin realignment—a slow, grinding sensation that Vela couldn't feel but he could, transmitted through his interface.\n\n\"Tell me about something you like,\" he said, keeping her focus away from the procedure. \"Do you have any pets?\"\n\n\"A rabbit. His name is Bounce.\"\n\n\"Does he sleep in your room?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. Mama says he shouldn't but Papa lets him.\"\n\nThe father managed a weak smile.\n\nThe bone guide clicked—proper alignment achieved. Orin applied the tissue mender next, letting it seal the break with biological adhesive that would be absorbed as the bone healed. Three weeks in a growth sleeve and she'd be climbing again.\n\nThe ribs were easier. He placed the mender against her side and let it work, sealing the cracks with patient precision.\n\nThroughout, he felt the Astravus beneath them both, supporting, monitoring, adjusting. It knew every cell in Vela's body the same way it knew every cell in its own.\n\n*Thank you,* he thought.\n\nThe Astravus responded with something that felt like gentle acknowledgment. *She is ours.*\n\n\"Done,\" Orin said, sitting back. \"She'll need rest, and I want to see her at the guild hall tomorrow for follow-up. But she's going to be fine.\"\n\nThe mother began to cry—relief, not grief.\n\nThe father pulled Vela carefully into his arms.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said. \"Thank you. We didn't know if—\"\n\n\"The fall was bad,\" Orin admitted. \"But she's strong. And she landed well.\"\n\nHe didn't add *the Astravus caught her*, but they probably knew.\n\n---\n\n## III.\n\nA Lattice Technician arrived—a young woman with a troubled expression. She glanced at the damaged climbing structure, then at Orin.\n\n\"I felt it give. The support vine. It was stressed. I should have—\"\n\n\"You can't check everything,\" Orin said. \"Fix it now. That's what matters.\"\n\nShe nodded and went to work, hands against the damaged lattice, beginning the slow process of rebalancing.\n\nOrin helped the family carry Vela toward their household. The girl was already drowsing, shock and the Astravus's pain suppression pulling her toward sleep.\n\nAt their threshold, the mother turned back.\n\n\"How do we—\" She hesitated. \"The cost. The guild. We want to—\"\n\nOrin shook his head. \"It's covered. Always.\"\n\nThis was the part outsiders never understood. The Biomedical Practitioners didn't charge for emergencies. The guild's reserves existed for exactly this: moments when someone fell and needed catching. Later, if the family wanted, they could contribute—most did, eventually—but there was no ledger, no debt, no obligation.\n\n\"Rest,\" Orin said. \"All of you. I'll see her tomorrow.\"\n\n---\n\nHe walked back through the terraces as the morning brightened, bioluminescent pathways shifting to daytime mode. The climbing structure was already half-repaired. By afternoon, children would be scaling it again.\n\nOrin stopped at a garden bench and sat, letting his heartbeat settle.\n\nThe summons had arrived at 0714. By 0738, Vela was stabilized and going home.\n\nTwenty-four minutes from injury to resolution.\n\nAnd yet it never felt fast enough.\n\nHe pulled out his tea—the fermented blend from the Collective, now cold—and drank it anyway. The familiar bitterness grounded him.\n\nOn the path nearby, a pair of children ran past, laughing at some private joke. They didn't notice him.\n\nThey didn't need to.\n\nThat was the point. The Biomedical Practitioners worked so that life could continue uninterrupted, so that a morning's accident became an afternoon's story and eventually a faded memory.\n\nOrin finished his tea and headed toward the guild hall.\n\nThere was always more work to do.\n\n---\n\n*End*"}]}
