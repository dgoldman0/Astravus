A profound *not-rightness* that made her skin crawl and her Core pulse with distress.\n\nShe was out of bed and dressed before she fully understood what was happening.\n\n*Lattice emergency. Sector 17-West. All available technicians respond.*\n\nSector 17-West was a residential area near the outer curve—older growth, families who had lived there for generations. She'd done routine maintenance there last month.\n\nNothing unusual.\n\nShe ran.\n\nThe bioluminescent pathways had shifted to emergency amber, guiding responders toward the crisis. Other technicians converged from side corridors, faces tight with the same unease Dara felt.\n\nWhen she reached Sector 17-West, she understood.\n\nA massive rift had opened in the wall. The organic tissue that comprised Lumen's body had torn open, exposing darker, more complex systems beneath. Fluid seeped from the edges, viscous and faintly luminescent. The surrounding walls were discolored, stressed, trembling.\n\nAnd beyond the wound, visible through the gap: the void. Stars. The cold impossibility of space, held back only by emergency membranes already straining.\n\n\"What happened?\" Dara pushed toward the cluster of technicians working at the wound's edge.\n\n\"We don't know yet.\" Senior Lattice Technician Mira didn't look up, hands pressed flat against the wounded wall. \"Structural failure. Deep. The outer layer gave way and triggered a cascade.\"\n\n\"Cascade?\"\n\n\"The lattice is overcompensating. Trying to seal the breach by pulling resources from adjacent sectors. If we don't stabilize it—\"\n\nShe didn't finish.\n\nShe didn't need to.\n\n---\n\n## II.\n\nDara placed her hands against the wall and opened her awareness.\n\nThe Astravus's distress hit her like a wave. Pain, yes, but something older and more elemental beneath it. A wounded animal's confusion. *Why does this hurt? What went wrong? Help.*\n\n*We're here,* Dara thought back as steadily as she could. *We're going to help.*\n\nMore responders arrived: Botanical Engineers carrying growth accelerants and tissue cultures, Biomedical Practitioners with tools that worked on organic systems regardless of scale.\n\nThe Astravus was a very large patient.\n\n\"We need to stop the cascade first,\" Mira said. \"The lattice is draining adjacent sectors to reinforce the breach. If it takes too much, we'll have failures in housing, in gardens—\"\n\n\"People live there,\" someone said, voice sharp with fear.\n\n\"I know. That's why we stop the cascade.\"\n\nDara joined the circle of technicians surrounding the wound. They worked in concert, hands pressed to walls, minds linked through their Cores. The lattice was a living thing, and convincing it to change behavior was like convincing a panicked muscle to relax.\n\n*Not there,* Dara thought, guiding a flow of resources away from a housing sector. *Take from the plaza instead. It's empty. It can recover.*\n\nThe lattice resisted. It didn't understand. It only knew the wound needed sealing and it would use whatever was closest.\n\n*Trust us. We know what we're doing.*\n\nSlowly, agonizingly, the cascade stabilized.\n\n---\n\n## III.\n\nThe Botanical Engineers moved in. Their work was stranger, more intimate. They carried cultures grown from Lumen's own tissue, cultivated over centuries for exactly these moments.\n\nA senior engineer named Roth pressed a living patch against the wound's edge and began coaxing it to bond.\n\n\"Easy,\" he murmured—to the patch, to the wound, to the Astravus itself. \"Easy. Accept it. It's part of you.\"\n\nThe tissue resisted at first. Foreign body response, even from something that was technically the same organism. But Roth was patient, and the Astravus was tired and hurting and wanted to heal.\n\nThe patch began to integrate.\n\nDara watched the edges of the wound slowly close, new tissue weaving over the gap, the terrible visibility of stars gradually obscured. The emergency membranes relaxed as the breach sealed.\n\nThree hours.\n\nBy the time it was done, Dara was exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with physical exertion. The mental effort of interfacing with a wounded system, of convincing the lattice to trust, of channeling her own calm into something that was afraid—it left her hollow.\n\nShe sat against the now-sealed wall and breathed.\n\nMira sat beside her. The older technician's face was drawn but calm.\n\n\"Good work.\"\n\n\"What caused it?\"\n\nMira was silent for a long moment. \"We don't know yet. Could be age—this sector is old. Could be stress accumulation. Could be something we haven't identified.\" She shook her head. \"The Astravii are living things. They get sick. They get injured. They have bad days.\"\n\n\"This seemed worse than a bad day.\"\n\n\"It was. But we caught it. That's what matters.\"\n\nOther technicians were dispersing now, heading home or to guild halls or to worried families. A few Biomedical Practitioners remained, monitoring the sealed wound.\n\nDara felt a faint pulse through her Core—not a summons, but something softer.\n\n*Thank you.*\n\nThe Astravus's gratitude was strange and vast, like being thanked by the ocean. It didn't know her name. It didn't think in names. But it knew she had helped, and it was grateful.\n\n*You're welcome. Rest now.*\n\n*You too.*\n\nShe almost laughed. The Astravus was telling her to rest.\n\n---\n\n## IV.\n\nDara stood and began the walk home. The pathways had returned to normal soft luminescence, the emergency amber fading. People emerged from their homes, cautious but curious, having felt the distress and now feeling the relief.\n\nA young mother caught Dara's eye as she passed, sleeping infant cradled against her chest.\n\n\"Was it bad?\"\n\n\"It was serious,\" Dara admitted. \"But it's healing now. Lumen will be fine.\"\n\nThe woman nodded, something loosening in her expression. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"It's what we do.\"\n\nThe guild hall was quiet when she arrived, most of the response team already gone. She found a cot in the rest area and lay down without removing her boots.\n\nSleep came quickly, and with it, dreams.\n\nShe dreamed she was floating in warmth, cradled by something vast and gentle. The Astravus's heartbeat thrummed around her—a rhythm that felt like breath and pulse combined. In the dream, she was very small, and that was all right.\n\nSmall things could heal large ones, if they worked together.\n\nWhen she woke, the light filtering through the windows was golden with late afternoon.\n\nHer Core pulsed with a status update: *Sector 17-West wound: healing proceeding normally. Secondary failures prevented. Casualty count: zero.*\n\nDara closed her eyes and let herself feel grateful.\n\nOutside, Lumen continued to breathe.\n\n---\n\n*End*"}]}
