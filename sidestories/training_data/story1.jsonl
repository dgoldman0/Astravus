Tamsin pressed her palm against the corridor wall and felt it shift beneath her touch, adjusting temperature by half a degree.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she murmured.\n\nThe wall warmed in response.\n\nShe'd been a lattice technician for nine years. Long enough to recognize fatigue in living architecture. Long enough to know when the Astravus was compensating for stress it shouldn't have to carry alone.\n\nThe eastern corridor had been singing wrong for three days—not loudly enough for residents to notice, but there. A hesitation in the resonance. Like someone trying to remember a word and finding only the shape of it.\n\nTamsin adjusted her interface band and placed both hands flat against the wall. The feedback came immediately: pressure distribution asymmetric, support vine cluster seven overloaded, backup systems engaged when they should be resting.\n\n\"You've been carrying too much,\" she said.\n\nThe corridor shimmered, almost embarrassed.\n\nShe smiled and began the work. Redirecting nutrient flow. Coaxing the eastern support cluster to share load with the underutilized western network. Encouraging new growth where old pathways had stiffened. It was like massage and surgery and negotiation all at once.\n\nFootsteps echoed at the far end of the hall.\n\n\"Oh—sorry! I thought this section was empty.\"\n\nTamsin glanced up. A girl stood frozen mid-step, maybe twelve, chestnut hair hastily tied back, eyes too bright for someone who should still be asleep. A black cat sat beside her, tail curled neatly over its paws.\n\n\"It's fine,\" Tamsin said. \"Just don't touch anything while I'm working.\"\n\nThe girl immediately clasped her hands behind her back. The cat, naturally, ignored this entirely and padded forward to inspect Tamsin with luminous green eyes.\n\n\"Shadow,\" the girl hissed. \"Leave her alone.\"\n\n\"She's fine.\" Tamsin returned her attention to the wall. \"Most people can't feel when I'm working. You can, can't you?\"\n\nThe girl hesitated. \"My sibling says I imagine it.\"\n\n\"You don't.\" Tamsin made a final adjustment and felt the corridor sigh with relief. \"You just don't have the vocabulary yet.\"\n\nShe stepped back. The hum had smoothed out, the walls realigning subtly. The space felt... lighter.\n\nThe girl was watching her with an expression Tamsin recognized. Curiosity wrestling with caution. The look of someone who understood more than they could articulate.\n\n\"Thank you for waiting,\" Tamsin said.\n\nThe girl grinned and darted off, Shadow flowing after her like living ink.\n\nTamsin listened to the footsteps fade, then checked her list.\n\nThe Tree of Echoes was next.\n\n---\n\n## II.\n\nShe felt it before she reached the clearing. A low resonance that touched the edges of thought—layered, complex, unsettled.\n\nThe Tree of Echoes was restless.\n\nTamsin circled the massive trunk, boots sinking into moss that pulsed with faint bioluminescence. The tree was older than most Astraviin alive today. Its roots threaded through memory-rich strata, touching moments from Lumen's earliest migrations. Birth. Bonding. First words spoken in rooms that no longer existed.\n\nAnd grief.\n\nThe tree remembered grief the way water remembered motion—taking shape from what passed through it.\n\nSomeone had been here recently. Small footprints tracked through the moss. A sketch pinned to the bark with a biodegradable clasp: three stick figures beneath oversized stars, colors bright enough to hurt.\n\nTamsin touched the drawing gently.\n\n\"Still teaching them,\" she said.\n\nThe tree responded with a creak—less sound than presence.\n\nShe placed both palms against the bark and opened her senses. The imbalance was immediate. Too much accumulated resonance, too many echoes without space to soften. A community that rarely lost anyone didn't develop good habits around letting go.\n\nThe work required care. She couldn't just erase the grief—that would dishonor it. Instead, she coaxed it outward, dispersing the sharpest edges into the surrounding lattice where they could mingle with other memories, becoming part of the background hum instead of a constant ache.\n\nBy the time she finished, her eyes were stinging and her breath came shallow.\n\nShe sat at the base of the tree and let herself be small for a while.\n\nVoices drifted past on the nearby path. A storyteller's cadence, measured and warm, followed by the shuffle of children's footsteps.\n\n\"…not just what happened,\" the storyteller was saying, \"but how it felt. That's what we remember.\"\n\nOne of the children lingered at the edge of the clearing, staring at the tree. Their expression was thoughtful, old beyond their years. Then they turned and hurried after the group.\n\nTamsin waited until the voices faded completely before standing.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she told the tree.\n\nIt responded with warmth deeper than temperature.\n\n---\n\n## III.\n\nThe Festival of Lights began at dusk.\n\nTamsin wasn't on duty, but she wandered the plaza anyway. Lanterns rose into the upper reaches of Lumen's canopy, each carrying something private—wishes, memories, hopes too fragile to speak aloud. Music layered through the crowd, organic and improvised.\n\nShe stood at the plaza's edge and watched people she barely knew celebrate with people they loved fiercely.\n\nA laugh cut through the music—bright, musical, infectious. A young woman was gesturing wildly at her companion, hands shaping invisible concepts, metaphors tumbling over each other faster than words could contain them. Her companion watched with the expression of someone who'd learned to translate enthusiasm into patience.\n\nNear the fountain, the girl from the corridor sat cross-legged with two older siblings, sketching the lanterns as they rose. The black cat sprawled beside her, utterly unimpressed by the spectacle.\n\nTamsin smiled.\n\nThis was the work.\n\nNot the grand transformations or elegant theories. Not transcendence or legacy or even memory, really.\n\nJust maintenance.\n\nNoticing strain before it became fracture. Making room for grief without letting it calcify. Ensuring that when people moved forward, the world moved with them.\n\nSomeone bumped into her—apologized—disappeared into the crowd.\n\nA lantern drifted past her face, close enough to feel its warmth.\n\nAbove, Lumen's bioluminescent ceiling pulsed in rhythm with the music, the Astravus participating in the only way it could. Tamsin felt the familiar hum beneath everything, steady and patient.\n\nThere was always more work to do.\n\nThe lattice never finished rebalancing. The Tree of Echoes would collect more grief. The corridors would develop new hesitations, new patterns of wear.\n\nAnd Tamsin would be there in the quiet hours, hands against living walls, listening for the things most people couldn't hear.\n\nShe turned away from the festival and headed back toward the eastern sector.\n\nSomeone would need her there tomorrow.\n\nAnd that was exactly how Lumen stayed whole.\n\n---\n\n*End*"}]}
