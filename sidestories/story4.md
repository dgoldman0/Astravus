# User Prompt

Write a short story set in Lumen about an emergency involving the Astravus itself—a section of Lumen's living body experiencing a crisis that threatens both the structure and its inhabitants. Show the Lattice Technicians, Botanical Engineers, and the Astravus's own consciousness working together to heal the wound. Include the fear and urgency of those involved, the strange intimacy of treating a living world, and the sense of relief when the crisis passes.

# When Lumen Bleeds

Dara felt it before the alarms sounded.

A wrongness. A profound *not-rightness* that made her skin crawl and her Core pulse with distress.

She was out of bed and dressed before she fully understood what was happening.

*Lattice emergency,* the summons said. *Sector 17-West. All available technicians respond.*

Sector 17-West was a quieter residential area near the outer curve of Lumen's body—older growth, families who had lived there for generations. Dara had worked there last month, routine maintenance. Nothing unusual.

She ran.

The streets of Lumen had already shifted to emergency mode. The bioluminescent pathways brightened with urgent amber, guiding responders toward the crisis. Other technicians converged from side corridors, their faces tight with the same unease Dara felt.

When she reached Sector 17-West, she understood.

A massive structural rift had opened in the wall—not a crack, but a wound. The organic tissue that comprised Lumen's body had torn open, exposing the darker, more complex systems beneath. Fluid seeped from the edges, viscous and faintly luminescent. The surrounding walls were discolored, stressed, trembling visibly.

And beyond the wound, visible through the gap: the void. Stars. The cold impossibility of space, held back only by emergency membranes that were already straining.

"What happened?" Dara demanded, pushing toward the cluster of technicians already working at the wound's edge.

"We don't know yet." Senior Lattice Technician Mira didn't look up from her work, hands pressed flat against the wounded wall. "Structural failure. Deep. The outer layer gave way and triggered a cascade."

"Cascade?"

"The lattice is overcompensating. It's trying to seal the breach, but it's pulling resources from adjacent sectors. If we don't stabilize it—"

She didn't finish. She didn't need to.

Dara placed her own hands against the wall and opened her awareness.

The Astravus's distress hit her like a wave.

Something older and more elemental. A wounded animal's confusion. *Why does this hurt? What went wrong? Help.*

*We're here,* Dara thought back, as steadily as she could. *We're going to help.*

More responders arrived: Botanical Engineers carrying growth accelerants and tissue cultures, Biomedical Practitioners with tools that worked on organic systems regardless of scale. The Astravus was a very large patient.

"We need to stop the cascade first," Mira was saying. "The lattice is draining adjacent sectors to reinforce the breach. If it takes too much, we'll have failures in housing, in gardens—"

"People live there," someone said, voice sharp with fear.

"I know." Mira's jaw tightened. "That's why we stop the cascade."

Dara joined the circle of technicians surrounding the wound. They worked in concert, hands pressed to the walls, minds linked through their Cores. The lattice was a living thing, woven through every part of Lumen, and convincing it to change behavior was like convincing a panicked muscle to relax.

*Not there,* Dara thought, guiding a flow of resources away from a housing sector. *Take from the plaza instead. It's empty. It can recover.*

The lattice resisted. It didn't understand. It only knew the wound needed sealing and it would use whatever was closest.

*Trust us,* Dara thought. *We know what we're doing.*

Slowly, agonizingly, the cascade stabilized.

The Botanical Engineers moved in next. Their work was stranger, more intimate. They carried cultures grown from Lumen's own tissue, cultivated over centuries for exactly these moments. A senior engineer named Roth pressed a living patch against the wound's edge and began coaxing it to bond.

"Easy," he murmured—to the patch, to the wound, to the Astravus itself. "Easy. Accept it. It's part of you."

The tissue resisted at first. Foreign body response, even from something that was technically the same organism. But Roth was patient, and the Astravus was tired and hurting and wanted to heal.

The patch began to integrate.

Dara watched the edges of the wound slowly close, new tissue weaving over the gap, the terrible visibility of stars gradually obscured. The emergency membranes relaxed as the breach sealed.

It took three hours.

By the time it was done, Dara was exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with physical exertion. The mental effort of interfacing with a wounded system, of convincing the lattice to trust, of channeling her own calm into something that was afraid—it left her hollow.

She sat against the now-sealed wall and breathed.

Mira sat beside her. The older technician's face was drawn but calm.

"Good work," Mira said.

"What caused it?"

Mira was silent for a long moment. "We don't know yet. Could be age—this sector is old. Could be stress accumulation. Could be something we haven't identified." She shook her head. "The Astravii are living things. They get sick. They get injured. They have bad days."

"This seemed worse than a bad day."

"It was." Mira looked at the sealed wall. "But we caught it. That's what matters."

Other technicians were dispersing now, heading home or to guild halls or to the families who would be worrying about them. A few Biomedical Practitioners remained, monitoring the sealed wound, ensuring no secondary complications developed.

Dara felt a faint pulse through her Core—not a summons, but something softer.

*Thank you.*

The Astravus's gratitude was strange and vast, like being thanked by the ocean. It didn't know her name. It didn't think in names. But it knew she had helped, and it was grateful.

*You're welcome,* Dara thought back. *Rest now.*

*You too.*

She almost laughed. The Astravus was telling her to rest.

Dara stood, stretched muscles that had been clenched for hours, and began the walk home. The pathways had returned to their normal soft luminescence, the emergency amber fading. People were emerging from their homes, cautious but curious, having felt the distress and now feeling the relief.

A young mother caught Dara's eye as she passed, a sleeping infant cradled against her chest.

"Was it bad?" the woman asked.

"It was serious," Dara admitted. "But it's healing now. Lumen will be fine."

The woman nodded, something loosening in her expression. "Thank you. For—" She gestured vaguely at everything.

"It's what we do."

Dara walked on.

The guild hall was quiet when she arrived, most of the response team already gone. She found a cot in the rest area and lay down without bothering to remove her boots.

Sleep came quickly, and with it, dreams.

She dreamed she was floating in warmth, cradled by something vast and gentle. The Astravus's heartbeat thrummed around her—a rhythm that felt like breath and pulse combined. In the dream, she was very small, and that was all right. Small things could heal large ones, if they worked together.

When she woke, the light filtering through the guild hall windows was golden with late afternoon.

Her Core pulsed with a status update: *Sector 17-West wound: healing proceeding normally. Secondary failures prevented. Casualty count: zero.*

Dara closed her eyes and let herself feel grateful.

Outside, Lumen continued to breathe.
