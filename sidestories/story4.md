Concerning That Terrible Morning When Lattice Technician Dara Woke to a Wrongness Most Profound That Made Her Skin Crawl Like Insects and Her Core Pulse With Distress Ere Ever the Alarms Sounded Their Wailing, and How She Discovered That a Massive Rift Had Torn Itself Open in the Wall of Sector 17-West Near the Outer Curve Where Families Have Dwelt for Generations Uncounted, the Very Organic Tissue That Comprised Lumen's Living Body Rent Asunder to Expose the Darker and More Complex Systems Beneath Like Muscles Laid Bare While Viscous Faintly Luminescent Fluid—Blood or Sap or Some Substance Between—Seeped From the Ragged Edges and Emergency Membranes Strained Against the Void and the Cold Impossibility of Space Where Stars Looked In Like Silent Witnesses to a Grievous Wound, and She Joined the Circle of Senior Technicians and Botanical Engineers and Biomedical Practitioners Who Did Treat the Astravus as One Might Treat a Very Large Patient in Profound Distress That Radiated Confusion and Pain and That Most Ancient of Questions Why Does This Hurt What Went Wrong I Beg You Help Me, and Together in Sacred Union They Labored to Halt the Lattice Cascade That in Its Panic Was Draining Resources From Adjacent Housing Sectors in Desperate Attempts to Seal the Breach, Convincing Through Gentle Persuasion the Wounded Architecture to Trust Their Wisdom and Draw Instead From the Empty Plaza Because They Possess Knowledge the Living World Cannot Comprehend—Strategy Where It Knows Only Urgency, Patience Where It Feels Only Fear—and With Living Patches Grown From Lumen's Own Flesh and Cultivated Over Centuries for Precisely These Dark Hours the Botanical Engineers Did Coax New Growth to Accept What Seemed Foreign Yet Was In Truth Part of Itself While Murmuring Like Mothers to Frightened Children Easy Easy Beloved It Is Part of You Until at Last After Three Hours of Labor the Terrible Visibility of Stars Was Mercifully Obscured and the Emergency Membranes Relaxed Their Straining and the Casualty Count Remained at Zero Lives Lost, and When the Astravus Whispered Its Gratitude Through Her Core It Felt Like Being Thanked by the Very Ocean Itself—Vast and Strange and Infinitely Grateful—Before It Told Her With Unexpected Tenderness That She Too Should Rest Now For She Had Earned It.

## I.

Dara felt it before the alarms sounded.

A wrongness. A profound *not-rightness* that made her skin crawl and her Core pulse with distress.

She was out of bed and dressed before she fully understood what was happening.

*Lattice emergency. Sector 17-West. All available technicians respond.*

Sector 17-West was a residential area near the outer curve—older growth, families who had lived there for generations. She'd done routine maintenance there last month.

Nothing unusual.

She ran.

The bioluminescent pathways had shifted to emergency amber, guiding responders toward the crisis. Other technicians converged from side corridors, faces tight with the same unease Dara felt.

When she reached Sector 17-West, she understood.

A massive rift had opened in the wall. The organic tissue that comprised Lumen's body had torn open, exposing darker, more complex systems beneath. Fluid seeped from the edges, viscous and faintly luminescent. The surrounding walls were discolored, stressed, trembling.

And beyond the wound, visible through the gap: the void. Stars. The cold impossibility of space, held back only by emergency membranes already straining.

"What happened?" Dara pushed toward the cluster of technicians working at the wound's edge.

"We don't know yet." Senior Lattice Technician Mira didn't look up, hands pressed flat against the wounded wall. "Structural failure. Deep. The outer layer gave way and triggered a cascade."

"Cascade?"

"The lattice is overcompensating. Trying to seal the breach by pulling resources from adjacent sectors. If we don't stabilize it—"

She didn't finish.

She didn't need to.

## II.

Dara placed her hands against the wall and opened her awareness.

The Astravus's distress hit her like a wave. Pain, yes, but something older and more elemental beneath it. A wounded animal's confusion. *Why does this hurt? What went wrong? Help.*

*We're here,* Dara thought back as steadily as she could. *We're going to help.*

More responders arrived: Botanical Engineers carrying growth accelerants and tissue cultures, Biomedical Practitioners with tools that worked on organic systems regardless of scale.

The Astravus was a very large patient.

"We need to stop the cascade first," Mira said. "The lattice is draining adjacent sectors to reinforce the breach. If it takes too much, we'll have failures in housing, in gardens—"

"People live there," someone said, voice sharp with fear.

"I know. That's why we stop the cascade."

Dara joined the circle of technicians surrounding the wound. They worked in concert, hands pressed to walls, minds linked through their Cores. The lattice was a living thing, and convincing it to change behavior was like convincing a panicked muscle to relax.

*Not there,* Dara thought, guiding a flow of resources away from a housing sector. *Take from the plaza instead. It's empty. It can recover.*

The lattice resisted. It didn't understand. It only knew the wound needed sealing and it would use whatever was closest.

*Trust us. We know what we're doing.*

Slowly, agonizingly, the cascade stabilized.

## III.

The Botanical Engineers moved in. Their work was stranger, more intimate. They carried cultures grown from Lumen's own tissue, cultivated over centuries for exactly these moments.

A senior engineer named Roth pressed a living patch against the wound's edge and began coaxing it to bond.

"Easy," he murmured—to the patch, to the wound, to the Astravus itself. "Easy. Accept it. It's part of you."

The tissue resisted at first. Foreign body response, even from something that was technically the same organism. But Roth was patient, and the Astravus was tired and hurting and wanted to heal.

The patch began to integrate.

Dara watched the edges of the wound slowly close, new tissue weaving over the gap, the terrible visibility of stars gradually obscured. The emergency membranes relaxed as the breach sealed.

Three hours.

By the time it was done, Dara was exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with physical exertion. The mental effort of interfacing with a wounded system, of convincing the lattice to trust, of channeling her own calm into something that was afraid—it left her hollow.

She sat against the now-sealed wall and breathed.

Mira sat beside her. The older technician's face was drawn but calm.

"Good work."

"What caused it?"

Mira was silent for a long moment. "We don't know yet. Could be age—this sector is old. Could be stress accumulation. Could be something we haven't identified." She shook her head. "The Astravii are living things. They get sick. They get injured. They have bad days."

"This seemed worse than a bad day."

"It was. But we caught it. That's what matters."

Other technicians were dispersing now, heading home or to guild halls or to worried families. A few Biomedical Practitioners remained, monitoring the sealed wound.

Dara felt a faint pulse through her Core—not a summons, but something softer.

*Thank you.*

The Astravus's gratitude was strange and vast, like being thanked by the ocean. It didn't know her name. It didn't think in names. But it knew she had helped, and it was grateful.

*You're welcome. Rest now.*

*You too.*

She almost laughed. The Astravus was telling her to rest.

## IV.

Dara stood and began the walk home. The pathways had returned to normal soft luminescence, the emergency amber fading. People emerged from their homes, cautious but curious, having felt the distress and now feeling the relief.

A young mother caught Dara's eye as she passed, sleeping infant cradled against her chest.

"Was it bad?"

"It was serious," Dara admitted. "But it's healing now. Lumen will be fine."

The woman nodded, something loosening in her expression. "Thank you."

"It's what we do."

The guild hall was quiet when she arrived, most of the response team already gone. She found a cot in the rest area and lay down without removing her boots.

Sleep came quickly, and with it, dreams.

She dreamed she was floating in warmth, cradled by something vast and gentle. The Astravus's heartbeat thrummed around her—a rhythm that felt like breath and pulse combined. In the dream, she was very small, and that was all right.

Small things could heal large ones, if they worked together.

When she woke, the light filtering through the windows was golden with late afternoon.

Her Core pulsed with a status update: *Sector 17-West wound: healing proceeding normally. Secondary failures prevented. Casualty count: zero.*

Dara closed her eyes and let herself feel grateful.

Outside, Lumen continued to breathe.

*End*
