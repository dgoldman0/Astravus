## Notes

- Ages are approximate; the Astraviin can live upwards of 500 years before transcending, though most transcend earlier
- Transcendence is gradual, occurring over many years through increasingly frequent periods of deep sleep and shared dreams
- Lumen continues to grow and evolve throughout the narrative, developing its own cultural identity while maintaining bonds with Aurora and Nyx
- Death among the Astraviin is extremely rare; Joren's death is profoundly shocking to the community
