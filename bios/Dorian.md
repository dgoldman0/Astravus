# Dorian

## Basic Information
- **Age:** 125+ years (approaching transcendence by later narrative)
- **Role in Story:** Oral Historian, personal testimony specialist, Calista's parent, member of family constellation
- **Home:** Lumen (the Astravus)
- **Constellation:** 5-member family with Maia, Arin, Selene, and Sage
- **Children:** Calista (middle child), Kael (older), Lyra (younger)

## Physical Description
Dorian is tall and broad-shouldered with rich dark skin and deep-set brown eyes that seem slightly unfocused when he's accessing memory. Glasses perch on the bridge of his wide nose. His hair is a mix of gray and black, always neatly trimmed, and he keeps a closely cropped beard that's gone mostly silver. He is left-handed in a household of right-handed people, with ink stains perpetually on the heel of his left hand from writing. He has a slight hunch from decades bent over texts—he declined correction because "my body tells my story." His voice is deep and resonant, capable of captivating any audience.

## Profession & Passion

### As an Oral Historian
Dorian specializes in capturing personal testimony before transcendence—recording and preserving individual voices, not just events. This is emotional, intimate work, not just scholarly. His expertise includes:
- Interviewing individuals about their life experiences
- Recording and preserving personal narratives before transcendence
- Researching and contextualizing historical records
- Studying ancient texts and scrolls
- Understanding the lineage and connections between Astravii
- Teaching history through compelling narrative
- Passing heritage and knowledge to new generations

### The Library
Dorian's library is his sanctuary:
- A cozy, inviting space with soft lamp glow
- Filled with books, scrolls, and archival materials
- Rustle of pages and scent of aged paper
- A place where stories come alive through reading and telling
- Atmosphere conducive to learning and reflection

### Historical Philosophy
Dorian believes:
- Stories preserve what otherwise would be lost
- Understanding the past is essential to understanding the present
- Every person's experience is part of the larger historical narrative
- History is not just facts but the living experience of ancestors
- Stories inspire and guide present and future generations

## Role in Family

Dorian's approach to parenting emphasizes:
- Storytelling and narrative education
- Connection to heritage and ancestral wisdom
- Curiosity about "what came before"
- Understanding context and significance
- Inspiring wonder about the wider universe

### Key Parenting Moments
- **Bedtime stories:** Gathering the family, holding up ancient maps, announcing: "Tonight, we'll hear about the great explorers of our past"
- **Inspiring adventure:** When Kael asks if they can follow the explorers' routes, Dorian replies: "Perhaps... but first, let's learn their stories"
- **Storytelling skill:** Using voice, presence, and theatrical ability to make history vivid and engaging

### With Extended Family
- Forms close friendship with Cassia's father Lyron, bonding over shared passion for history

## Relationship with History & Storytelling

### The Stories He Tells
Dorian recounts:
- Great explorers of the past and their journeys beyond known stars
- Encounters with strange creatures and new worlds
- Historical connections to Aurora and Nyx
- The early days of Lumen's formation and growth
- Ancestral deeds and lessons

### Connection to Broader Lumen History
One notable story within the story that Dorian tells involves three siblings (Aria, Bram, and Cora) aboard a great Astravus. In this nested narrative:
- They face a community crisis (water system failure)
- Each sibling wants to solve it differently
- They learn the value of cooperation and combining different strengths
- The story becomes a teaching tool for lessons about unity and collaboration

This demonstrates how Dorian uses historical narratives and parables to teach deeper truths about community and human nature.
