## Physical Description
Lyra is small and spritely with a dancer's light, nimble build. Her skin is a golden tan with warm olive undertones, and her face is covered in a constellation of golden freckles that intensify in the sun. Her golden-blonde curls are unruly and often escaping whatever style she attempts, frequently adorned with small clips or ribbons. Wide green eyes—a bright, clear emerald—give her a perpetually curious expression and seem to see everything. She has a button nose and a gap between her front teeth that shows when she laughs. Her ears are slightly pointed—a genetic quirk she considers "elfin." Small for her age even as an adult, she makes up for stature with boundless energy and expressiveness, always moving and always exploring.
