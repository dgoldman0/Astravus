## Physical Description
Sage has round, soft features that make them look younger than their years. Their skin is a warm tan with rosy undertones, and their gray eyes seem to change shade with the light—sometimes pale silver, sometimes deep storm. They have short, sandy hair and a heavily freckled complexion—freckles across their cheeks, nose, shoulders, and arms. Of medium height and build, they appear neither imposing nor diminutive. Most distinctive is their unusually warm body temperature; people comment on how warm their hands are. They are almost always barefoot indoors, a sensory preference that grounds them. Their soothing voice is capable of easing any troubled heart. Everything about their physical presence suggests warmth, safety, and emotional availability.

### Kael and Sage's Parenting
When Calista observes their family:
- Sees real-life example of successful nurturing environment
