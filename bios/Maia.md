### Later Years
As Maia ages toward transcendence:
- Spends increasing time in deep connection with Lumen
- Gradually becomes more ethereal in her presence
- Devotes more time to reflecting and integrating with the Astravus
- Her time with family becomes more precious and intentional

### Final Conversations with Calista
In one particularly meaningful exchange:
- Calista expresses missing their long talks and shared moments
- Maia explains: "It's part of the journey, Cali. As we prepare for transcendence, we spend more time reflecting and connecting with Lumen."
- Offers reassurance: "I'll always be a part of you, Cali. My love, my lessons, they will remain with you."

### Transcendence Process
As Maia transitions into Lumen's collective consciousness:
- Her presence in family's daily life becomes increasingly limited
