# FRAGMENTSFULL.md - Master Fragment Extraction Plan

This document defines the **master extraction plan** for mapping all 276 narrative fragments to disjoint, comprehensive line ranges in `latest.md`.

**Canonical Reference**: `wiki/FRAGMENTS.md` (fragment names and summaries)  
**Source Text**: `revision/latest.md` (1300 lines)  
**Training Data**: `voxservice_training/training_data/core/fragments.jsonl`

---

## Design Principles

### DISJOINT
All fragment line ranges are non-overlapping. Fragment N ends at line X, fragment N+1 starts after X.

### COMPREHENSIVE  
Together, fragments span all narrative content (excluding headers, images).

### PRESERVATION
Original 276 fragment names from `wiki/FRAGMENTS.md` are preserved. Short fragments expanded rather than adding new ones.

## Source Structure (VERIFIED)

| Section | Lines | Exclude | Fragments |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Book I: Earliest Memories | 5-354 | 4 (img), 285 (img) | #1-42 |
| Book I: Early Friendships | 358-542 | 355 (hdr), 357 (img) | #43-73 |
| Book II: Growing Up | 545-647 | 543-544 (hdrs) | #74-105 |
| Book II: Young Adulthood | 649-837 | 648 (hdr) | #106-150 |
| Book III: Starting a Family | 840-1052 | 838-839 (hdrs) | #151-180 |
| Book III: Later Years | 1054-1178 | 1053 (hdr) | #181-224 |
| Book IV: Transcendence | 1180-1300 | 1179 (hdr) | #225-276 |

**Total content lines**: ~1275 (excluding 13 header/image lines)  
**Fragments**: 276  
**Average lines per fragment**: ~4.6

---

## Extraction Rules

1. **Skip** lines 1, 2, 4, 285, 355, 357, 543, 544, 648, 838, 839, 1053, 1179 (headers/images)
2. **Cut at paragraph breaks** (blank lines between paragraphs)
3. **Preserve italics** (`_text_`) and asides (`\begin{aside}`)
4. **Fragment boundaries** should align with natural narrative transitions

**KNOWN ISSUES**: 
- Fragments 17-23 have overlapping/incorrect line numbers due to complex content interleaving
- The original source has repeated visits to same locations (e.g., Arin's workshop appears twice)
- Lines 115-198 contain Lyra's room, Maia's garden scenes, workshop scenes, music room, library, Sage's room, and three siblings story - these need careful extraction during actual fragment processing

## Book IV: Transcendence (Fragments 225-276) — Lines 1180-1300

Book IV spans 121 lines for 52 fragments (~2.3 lines average). Fragments in this section are shorter vignettes of dream experiences.

**Issue**: 52 fragments for 121 lines means heavy compression. Many original "fragments" may need to be merged or marked as covering just 1-2 lines each.

---

## Known Issues

### Line Number Accuracy
- ✓ = Verified against source text
- ○ = Approximate, needs verification

### Content Duplication
Book III "Later Years" contains duplicate grandparent scenes that appear in "Starting a Family". During extraction, avoid duplicate fragments.

### Fragment Compression
Book IV has 52 fragments for 121 lines, requiring very short fragments (~2 lines each). Some conceptual fragments may need to be combined or marked as sub-fragments.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Run line verification** for high-priority fragments (those with ○ status)
2. **Mark duplicates** in Later Years section
3. **Combine short fragments** in Book IV where narratively appropriate
4. **Update training data** if any renames occur

---

## Alignment with wiki/FRAGMENTS.md

This document uses the **canonical 276 fragment names** from `wiki/FRAGMENTS.md`. Both documents must remain synchronized.

If fragments are renamed or combined, track changes here:

| Old # | Old Name | New # | New Name | Reason |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| — | — | — | — | No changes yet |

---

## Training Data Status

All 276 fragments have been processed into `fragments.jsonl` with the seven-turn conversation format. If fragment boundaries change, training data needs regeneration.

## Verified Anchor Points

The following key text anchors have been verified against `revision/latest.md`:
