## 1. Book Structure Changes

### Issue 1.1: Book II Title and Structure
**Prototype Current State:**
- `# Book II` with no subtitle, followed by `## Notes` and `## Growing Up`

**Wiki (TIMELINE.md) States:**
- Book II: Growing Up

- Remove or relocate the `## Notes` section (author notes shouldn't be in the narrative)

### Issue 1.2: Part III Title
**Prototype Current State:**
- `# Part III` with no subtitle, followed by `## Starting a Family`

**Wiki (TIMELINE.md) States:**
- Book III: Family and Maturity

**Correction Required:**
- Change `# Part III` to `# Book III: Family and Maturity`

### Issue 1.3: Missing Book IV Title
**Prototype Current State:**
- `## Transcendence` appears as a subsection under the Later Years content

**Wiki (TIMELINE.md) States:**
- Book IV: Transcendence (separate book)

**Correction Required:**

---

## 2. Character Role/Identity Errors

### Issue 2.1: Joren's Mother Soren - Mural Attribution Error
**Prototype States (~line 512):**
> "Joren's death left an indelible mark on Lumen. The vibrant murals his mother, **Soren**, had painted took on new layers of meaning"

**Wiki (CHARACTERS.md) States:**
- Joren's mother **Soren** is an "Emergency Response and Safety Systems Designer," NOT an artist
- Murals are made by **Thalia** (Cassia's mother), who creates murals as "meditative practice"

**Correction Required:**
Remove the attribution of murals to Soren.

**Current Text:**
> "Joren's death left an indelible mark on Lumen. The vibrant murals his mother, Soren, had painted took on new layers of meaning, blending sorrow and beauty."

**Corrected Text:**
> "Joren's death left an indelible mark on Lumen. The murals that adorned our community spaces took on new layers of meaning, blending sorrow and beauty."

### Issue 2.2: Theron's Role (Confirmed Correct)
**Prototype Notes Section States:**
> "Should change Theron to a grandparent or something."

**Wiki (bios/Theron.md) States:**
- Theron is correctly portrayed as a 400-year-old elder from Aurora, NOT a family member
- He is a "wisdom keeper" and mentor

**Status:** The prototype NARRATIVE is correct per wiki. Only the author notes suggest a change that was NOT and SHOULD NOT be implemented. The notes section should be removed.

### Issue 2.3: Sage's Dual Role (Confirmed Correct)
**Prototype States:**
- Sage is one of Calista's five parents
- Kael later forms constellation with Sage and Sol

**Wiki Confirms:**
- This is CORRECT. Sage serves both roles.

**Status:** No correction needed.

## 3. Character Physical Description Inconsistencies

### Issue 3.1: Maia's Hair Description
**Prototype States (~line 39):**

**Correction:**
Change to: "long, curly hair containing small braids woven with seeds and dried flowers"

### Issue 3.2: Arin's Hair Color
**Prototype States (~line 43):**
> "short-cropped dark hair"

**Wiki (bios/Arin.md) States:**

**Correction:**
Change "dark hair" to "auburn hair"

### Issue 3.3: Selene's Hair Color
**Prototype States (~line 46):**
> "flowing silver hair"

**Wiki (bios/Selene.md) States:**
> "pure white hair (premature, genetic, started at 30)"

**Correction:**
Change "silver hair" to "white hair"

### Issue 3.4: Sage's Eye Description
**Prototype States (~line 52):**
> "soft, kind eyes"

**Wiki (CHARACTERS.md) States:**
> "Gray eyes that seem to change shade with the light—sometimes pale silver, sometimes deep storm"

**Correction:**
Change to: "soft gray eyes that seemed to change shade with the light"

### Issue 3.5: Missing Skin Descriptions (Enhancement)
The wiki provides detailed skin descriptions for all characters that are not in the prototype:

**Status:** Not in prototype. Consider adding.

---

## 4. Character Profession/Title Inconsistencies

**Wiki:** "Ecological Systems Designer; Botanist"
**Correction:** Change to "Maia, an ecological systems designer"

**Prototype (~line 42):** "Arin, an engineer"
**Wiki:** "Biomechanical Interface Designer; Engineer"
**Correction:** Change to "Arin, a biomechanical interface designer"

**Wiki:** "Oral Historian; Personal Testimony Specialist"

- ✅ Kael later forms constellation with Sage and Sol
- ✅ Constellation terminology used correctly

**Status:** Family structure in prototype matches wiki. No corrections needed.

---

## 6. Character Parent Background Errors

### Issue 6.1: Thalia's Profession (Cassia's Mother)
**Prototype States (~line 278-282):**
> "Her mother, Thalia, was an elegant woman with an artist's soul. She had an aura of serenity and grace, often dressed in flowing clothes splattered with paint. Thalia's eyes mirrored the same deep green as Cassia's, a testament to their close bond. She was known for the beautiful murals that adorned the walls of Lumen, transforming everyday spaces into vibrant scenes of wonder and imagination."

**Wiki (CHARACTERS.md) States:**
> "Community mediator and conflict resolver (art is her hobby, not profession); elegant woman of medium height with warm sienna skin, high cheekbones, and deep green eyes like Cassia; silver threads through her dark hair, worn in an intricate updo; moves with deliberate calm that puts others at ease; helps families and individuals navigate disputes; her murals are meditative practice"

**Corrections Required:**
1. Change profession from artist to community mediator
2. Remove "splattered with paint" (she'd be clean for her work)
3. Add "warm sienna skin" and "silver threads through her dark hair"
4. Clarify murals are personal practice, not profession

**Corrected Text:**
> "Her mother, Thalia, was an elegant woman of medium height with warm sienna skin and silver threads through her dark hair, worn in an intricate updo. She worked as a community mediator and conflict resolver, helping families navigate disputes. In her personal time, she created beautiful murals as a meditative practice, transforming everyday spaces into vibrant scenes of wonder and imagination. Thalia's deep green eyes mirrored Cassia's, a testament to their close bond."

### Issue 6.2: Lyron's Profession (Cassia's Father)
**Prototype States (~line 285-288):**
> "Cassia's father, Lyron, was a tall man with a gentle demeanor. His salt-and-pepper hair and kind, hazel eyes gave him an air of wisdom and warmth. Lyron was a historian with a passion for sharing tales of our ancestors and the wonders of the cosmos."

**Wiki (CHARACTERS.md) States:**
> "Agricultural systems manager with copper-brown skin weathered by outdoor work, salt-and-pepper hair, a square jaw, and kind hazel eyes; tall with broad hands and an easy smile; manages Lumen's food production and distribution; practical, logistical work that keeps community fed; shares history as amateur interest (bonds with Dorian over this)"

**Corrections Required:**
1. Change profession from historian to agricultural systems manager
2. Add "copper-brown skin weathered by outdoor work"
3. History is hobby, not profession

**Corrected Text:**
> "Cassia's father, Lyron, was a tall, rugged man with copper-brown skin weathered by years of outdoor work, salt-and-pepper hair, and kind hazel eyes. He managed Lumen's food production and distribution, but his true passion was history. Through their shared love of the past, Lyron and my father Dorian became close friends, often spending hours exchanging tales of our ancestors and the wonders of the cosmos."

### Issue 6.3: Soren's Profession (Joren's Mother)
**Prototype States (~line 308-311):**
> "His mother, Soren, was a dynamic woman with a quick mind and nimble fingers, always dressed in practical work clothes smudged with grease and oil from her latest projects... Soren designed many of the systems that kept Lumen running smoothly, her workshop a testament to her ingenuity, filled with blueprints, tools, and half-finished inventions."

**Wiki (CHARACTERS.md) States:**
> "Emergency Response and Safety Systems Designer; athletic woman... designed many of Lumen's safety systems—systems that ironically couldn't save her son"

**Correction:**
Change "systems that kept Lumen running smoothly" to "emergency response and safety systems"

**Corrected Text:**
> "Soren designed many of Lumen's emergency response and safety systems, her workshop a testament to her ingenuity, filled with blueprints, tools, and half-finished inventions."

---

## 7. Pronoun Inconsistencies

### Issue 7.1: Aris Uses He/Him (Not They/Them)
**Prototype Uses:** "they/them" pronouns for Aris throughout

**Wiki (bios/Aris.md) Uses:** "he/him" pronouns
- Referred to as "father" not "parent"
- Wiki text consistently uses "his," "he," "him"

**Correction Required:**
Change ALL Aris pronouns from they/them to he/him throughout the document.

**Examples to change:**
- "Aris brought their digital piano" → "Aris brought his digital piano"
- "their eyes sparkling" → "his eyes sparkling"
- "they said" → "he said"
- "them" (referring to Aris) → "him"

**Scope:** This affects numerous lines throughout Book II, III, and IV.

### Issue 7.2: Lyra Uses She/Her (Confirmed in Wiki)
**Prototype Uses:** Some instances of "they/them" for Lyra (e.g., "their curiosity")

**Wiki (bios/Lyra.md) Uses:** "she/her" pronouns consistently

**Correction Required:**
Review all Lyra references and ensure she/her pronouns are used throughout.

### Issue 7.3: Arin and Sage Use They/Them (Confirmed Correct)
Both prototype and wiki use they/them for Arin and Sage.
**Status:** No correction needed.

---

## 8. Missing Character Descriptions

### Issue 8.1: Aris Has No Physical Description at Introduction
**Prototype Issue:**
When Aris is introduced (~line 680), no physical description is provided.

**Wiki (bios/Aris.md) States:**
> "compact, muscular build... rich black hair worn in long locs, often tied back... warm brown skin with reddish undertones... distinctive heterochromia—left eye dark brown, right eye hazel-green... wide, expressive mouth... small scar on chin"

**Correction Required:**
Add physical description when Aris is first introduced.

**Insert after "I met Aris at one of my art workshops":**
> "Aris had a compact, muscular build, with rich black hair worn in long locs that he often tied back while working. His warm brown skin had reddish undertones, and what struck me most were his eyes—distinctive heterochromia gave him one dark brown eye and one hazel-green, creating a memorable and striking appearance."

### Issue 8.2: Elara's Heterochromia Not Mentioned
**Wiki (bios/Elara.md) States:**
> "Elara inherits her father Aris's distinctive heterochromia but reversed—her right eye is dark brown while her left eye is hazel-green. She has Calista's freckle pattern but more pronounced."

**Correction Required:**
When describing Elara as an adult (around lines 950-960), add:
> "Elara had inherited her father's distinctive heterochromia but reversed—her right eye was dark brown while her left was hazel-green. My freckle pattern showed more pronounced on her face, scattered generously across her cheeks and nose."

---

## 9. Minor Narrative Inconsistencies

### Issue 9.1: Lysandra "Composed a Song"
**Prototype States (~line 610-612):**
> "There were moments of pure joy, like when Lysandra composed a song just for me, her fingers dancing across the keys of a digital piano."

**Wiki (CHARACTERS.md - Lysandra) States:**
> "Primary passion is mathematics and pattern recognition... Fascinated with the mathematics underlying music rather than performing it"

**Correction Required:**
Lysandra wouldn't "compose a song" in the traditional sense. Reframe to match her mathematical nature.

**Corrected Text:**
> "There were moments of pure joy, like when Lysandra created a mathematical sequence just for me—a pattern that, when translated into sound through a digital piano, revealed a hauntingly beautiful melody hidden in the numbers."

### Issue 9.2: Event file inconsistency reference in TIMELINE - "Lysandra's Song"
**TIMELINE.md States:**
> "[Lysandra's Song](events/Lysandras-Song.md) | Lysandra composes a song for Calista"

**Status:** This should also be corrected in TIMELINE.md and the event file, but that's outside the prototype scope. Note for wiki consistency work.

---

## 10. Notes Section Removal

### Issue 10.1: Author Notes Embedded in Narrative
**Prototype Contains (~lines 577-605):**
An entire `## Notes` section with author meta-commentary including:
- "I changed Aerin's name to Sage"
- "I added fur babies"
- "Should change Theron to a grandparent or something"
- Discussion of "utamn" and "shaari" concepts
- Ideas about nanomachines

**Correction Required:**
Remove the entire `## Notes` section from the narrative. This is meta-commentary that should not be part of the story text.

**Action:**
Delete from `## Notes` through to `## Growing Up`

**Preservation:**
Content could be moved to CHANGEIDEAS.md or a separate planning document.
