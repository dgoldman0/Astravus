# CHANGELOG - Astravus Calista Character Development

## Overview
This document tracks all changes made to the character documentation system for "Astravus - Calista (Full Arc Prototype)" from initial extraction through comprehensive development and refinement.

---

## Phase 1: Initial Character Extraction & Documentation
**Objective:** Extract all characters from source material and create organized documentation system.

### Files Created
- **CHARACTERS.md** - Master character reference with all 18+ characters
- **bios/** - New directory for individual character files
- **bios/INDEX.md** - Navigation guide and character connections map
- **bios/Calista.md** - Protagonist bio
- **bios/Aris.md** - Partner bio
- **bios/Elara.md** - Daughter bio
- **bios/Maia.md** - Parent/Guardian bio
- **bios/Arin.md** - Parent/Guardian bio
- **bios/Selene.md** - Parent/Guardian bio
- **bios/Dorian.md** - Parent/Guardian bio
- **bios/Sage.md** - Parent/Guardian bio
- **bios/Kael.md** - Sibling bio
- **bios/Lyra.md** - Sibling bio
- **bios/Cassia.md** - Friend bio
- **bios/Joren.md** - Friend bio (deceased)
- **bios/Lysandra.md** - First romantic interest bio
- **bios/Theron.md** - Elder mentor bio
- **bios/Shadow.md** - Familiar bio
- **bios/Lumen.md** - Setting as character

### Initial Character Count
- 5 core family members (parents/guardians)
- 3 siblings (including Calista)
- 3+ childhood friends
- 1 elder
- 1 primary familiar
- 1 living setting (Astravus)
- Secondary characters (Thalia, Lyron, Soren, Kaleb)

---

## Phase 2: Quality Assessment & Redundancy Review
**Objective:** Evaluate existing character documentation for weaknesses and redundancies.

### EVALUATION.md Created
Comprehensive analysis identifying:

**Redundancy Issues:**
- Multiple musicians (Selene, Lysandra, Aris) - too concentrated
- Multiple adventurers (Kael, Lyra, Joren) - overlapping roles
- Parent constellation roles unclear - differentiation needed
- Secondary character parents (Thalia, Lyron, Soren, Kaleb) underdeveloped

**Characterization Weaknesses:**
- Many characters had minimal personality quirks
- Physical descriptions were thin and generic in places
- Role diversity was limited
- Parent roles needed clearer differentiation
- Lysandra's musician element conflicted with mathematical theorist focus

**Strengths Identified:**
- Strong core narrative arc
- Diverse immediate family constellation
- Clear emotional throughlines
- Well-developed protagonist perspective

---

## Phase 3: Conceptual Refinement - Flaws to Quirks
**Objective:** Replace problematic "flaws" with distinctive "quirks" and develop characters more deeply.

### Key Direction Change
**User Clarification:** "Flaws should not exist, only quirks. Quirks of the parents would also help differentiate them more."

A quirk is defined as: An extreme trait that doesn't cause distress or disorder, just makes the character distinctively memorable.

### CHANGEIDEAS.md Created
Comprehensive proposal document with specific changes for all 16+ characters.

**Major Conceptual Changes Proposed:**
1. **Lysandra:** Changed from "musician" to "mathematical theorist" (resolved musician overcrowding)
2. **Kael:** Added extended role and family formation
3. **Lyra:** Developed explorer identity more fully
4. **Sol:** Promoted from unnamed to full character development (Resource Coordinator)
5. **Parent Quirks Added:**
   - Maia: Talks to plants, cannot sit indoors long, collects seeds obsessively
   - Arin: Thinks by building, hums mechanical rhythms, keeps "retired" machines
   - Selene: Perfect pitch "curse", composes in sleep, synesthetic pitch-to-emotion
   - Dorian: Memory palaces obsession, writes everything twice, only reads non-fiction
   - Sage: Collects worried thoughts, temperature-emotion connection, blanket accumulation

**Role Expansions:**
- Thalia: Elevated to "Community Mediator" with mediation expertise
- Lyron: Elevated to "Agricultural Systems Manager" with expanded role
- Aris: Added composition philosophy (composes for specific people)
- Elara: Deepened engineer identity with specific artistic medium

**New Character Development:**
- **Sol** fully developed: Resource Coordinator, synesthete, 28-hour sleep cycle, list-maker, touch-averse with exceptions

---

## Phase 4: Implementation of Conceptual Changes
**Objective:** Edit all character files to reflect CHANGEIDEAS.md proposals.
