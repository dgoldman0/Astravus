## Detailed Account

The arrival of a third child is a different experience from the first or second. Where Kael's arrival established the constellation as parents and Calista's expanded their capacity, Lyra's completes the trio of siblings who will grow up together in Lumen.

For Calista, no longer the youngest, Lyra's arrival is a significant transition. She is now a middle child with responsibilities and opportunities to guide and protect this new family member. From the first moments, it's clear that Lyra is different—not in value but in nature, with a particular spark of curiosity already visible.

Even as an infant, hints of the adventurous spirit that will later lead Lyra to explore other Astravii are present—a restlessness, a curiosity about everything just beyond reach, wide green eyes that seem to take in everything.

The five-parent constellation welcomes their third and final child, and with Lyra, the family feels complete. Kael, Calista, and Lyra will grow up together, each finding their own path while remaining connected through the bonds of their shared upbringing.
