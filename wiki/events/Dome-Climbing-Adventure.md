## Description

One day, while exploring a newly built section of Lumen, the children came across a massive, unfinished dome. The scaffolding and machinery were left unattended, and it looked like the perfect place for an adventure.

Joren's eyes gleamed with excitement. "Let's climb to the top and see what the view is like!"

Despite some initial hesitation, they all agreed. They carefully made their way up the scaffolding, hearts pounding with a mix of fear and exhilaration. The higher they climbed, the more amazing the view became.

### Reaching the Top

When they finally reached the top, they were awestruck by the sight of Lumen spread out below them.

"This is amazing," Cassia whispered, her voice filled with wonder. "It's like we're on top of the world."

"We are on top of the world!" Joren declared, raising his arms triumphantly.

They spent the rest of the afternoon up there, imagining grand adventures and secret missions. As the light began to dim, casting a golden glow over the garden below, they carefully made their way back down.

Shadow led the way during the descent, her agile form moving gracefully across the beams. Barkley stayed close to Lyra, ensuring she was safe. Nibble perched on Cassia's shoulder, surveying their path.

They promised each other they would return to their new secret hideout soon.
