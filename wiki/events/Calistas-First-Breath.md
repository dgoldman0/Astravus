## Description

Calista's First Breath marks her emergence into the world. Her parents—Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, and Sage—had been preparing for this moment, eagerly awaiting the arrival of a new child to their constellation.

The moment was recounted to Calista throughout her childhood, the story becoming almost tangible through her parents' loving retellings. They described holding her in their waiting arms, the warmth and joy of welcoming her into their lives. Their excitement was palpable as they brought her home from the Sanctuary.

Upon arriving at the family home:
- **Shadow** (the family cat) curiously watched over the newborn, her green eyes glinting in the low light
- **Barkley** (the golden retriever) gently nudged Calista's tiny hands with his nose, his fur soft and comforting
- **Nibble** (the family rat) was already exploring, her tiny feet tickling as she scurried around the crib

Though Calista has no direct memory of this moment, her parents' stories made the event feel real and formative, establishing the foundation of love and belonging that would characterize her entire life.

## Notes

- First Breath is analogous to birth but carries specific cultural significance among the Astraviin
- The five-parent constellation is noted as unusually large, even for Lumen's culture of larger family units
