## Description

As time passed, Calista found ways to honor Joren's memory. She painted a mural in Maia's garden, depicting the adventures they had shared and the dreams they had for the future.

### The Creative Process

Calista threw herself into painting, using her art to process her emotions and keep Joren's memory alive. Each brushstroke was a way to honor him, to capture the essence of the adventures they had shared.

Shadow often sat by her side as she painted, her green eyes watching intently, offering silent comfort. Barkley, sensing her sadness, would rest his head on her lap, his presence a steady reminder that she was not alone. Even Nibble, with her curious explorations and deeper awareness, seemed to offer moments of distraction and solace.

### The Mural Itself

The mural depicted their shared adventures and the dreams they had for the future. It became a permanent fixture in the garden—a place of solace and remembrance where Calista could feel close to Joren and find strength in their memories.
