## Detailed Account

The Radiant Fields of Luxa are known throughout Astravian civilization as a place of extraordinary beauty and spiritual power. The fields themselves are natural phenomena—luminescent vegetation or mineral formations that create landscapes of shifting, living light.

Calista's visit to Luxa comes as she enters the later phase of her life. Perhaps it is a deliberate pilgrimage, seeking connection to something larger. Perhaps it is a gift or happenstance. Regardless of how she arrives, the experience is transformative.

Walking through the fields, Calista feels the boundary between herself and the universe grow thin. The light seems to pulse with a rhythm that matches her heartbeat. Beauty surrounds her so completely that her usual sense of self as observer begins to dissolve—she becomes part of what she observes.

Here, she understands more fully what transcendence means. The separation between individual and collective, between person and universe, is revealed as less solid than it appears in daily life. The fields of Luxa offer a preview of what awaits in Lumen.

Calista brings back from this experience a deeper peace, a greater readiness for what lies ahead. She has touched something eternal, and it has touched her in return.
