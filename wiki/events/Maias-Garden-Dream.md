## Detailed Account

The garden appears in the dream exactly as Calista remembers it—the careful plantings, the morning light, the sense of life cultivated with patient love. But there is something more: a luminosity that infuses everything, a sense that this garden exists not in space but in consciousness.

And then Maia is there. Not as a ghost or a memory, but as a presence—transformed by transcendence yet still recognizably herself. She carries the essence of everything Calista loved about her mother: the gentle wisdom, the nurturing patience, the deep quiet love.

They don't speak in words exactly—communication in this space is more direct, more complete. But what passes between them carries the weight of everything unsaid, every thank you never quite expressed, every moment of love that words couldn't capture.

Maia shares something of what transcendence is like—not as explanation but as experience. Calista feels, for a moment, what it means to be part of Lumen: the dissolution of isolation, the connection to all consciousness, the peace that comes from merging with something infinite.

When Calista wakes, she carries the encounter with her. Her grief for her mother shifts—not disappearing, but transforming into something that includes joy. Maia is not gone; she is everywhere.
