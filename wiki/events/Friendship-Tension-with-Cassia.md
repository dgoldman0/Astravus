## Description

As Cassia's writing career took off, she found herself with less time to spend with Calista. Her stories, which had once been a shared adventure, became more personal and introspective. Calista struggled with the feeling of being left behind, watching as Cassia pursued her dreams.

### The Confrontation

One evening, as they sat together in the garden, Calista finally voiced her feelings:

> **Calista:** "Cassia, I feel like we're drifting apart. You're so busy with your writing, and I miss the way things used to be."
> 
> **Cassia:** "Cali, I'm sorry if I've made you feel that way. My writing is important to me, but so are you. I promise I'll make more time for us."

### The Realization

Cassia's words were reassuring, but Calista knew that things would never be quite the same. They were all growing and changing, and their friendships had to adapt to these new realities. It was a bittersweet realization, but one that made Calista appreciate the moments they did have together even more.
