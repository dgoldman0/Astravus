## Overview

---

## Setting

**Location:** Lumen's central plaza and throughout the community  
**Time Period:** Immediately following Joren's death  
**Conditions:** A community in profound, unprecedented grief

---

## Description

The entire community mourned with Calista and Cassia, their collective grief a testament to how rare and profound this loss was. The central plaza, usually a place of celebration and joy, became a gathering spot for quiet reflection and shared sorrow.

### The Tribute

The plaza was adorned with flowers and messages, creating a living tribute to Joren's spirit. Community members gathered to share stories, shed tears, and support one another through the unimaginable.

### Kaleb's Speech

At one of these gatherings, Joren's father Kaleb spoke to the community, his voice steady but filled with emotion:

> "Joren was a light in our lives. He had a boundless spirit and an insatiable curiosity. He taught us all the value of adventure and the importance of living each day to the fullest. Let us honor his memory by continuing to explore, to learn, and to cherish the time we have together."

### The Community's Response

Lumen had never experienced a loss like this before. The Astraviin, accustomed to transcendence rather than death, had no established rituals for mourning the young. The community had to find new ways to grieve and remember.

### Soren's Legacy

The vibrant murals Joren's mother, Soren, had painted took on new layers of meaning, blending sorrow and beauty. Her work became part of the memorial landscape.
