## Detailed Account

Transcendence is not death in the traditional sense—it is transformation, the dissolution of individual consciousness into the greater whole of Lumen. The person does not cease to exist; they become part of something larger, their essence joining countless others who have transcended before them.

Yet for those who remain behind in physical form, transcendence carries the weight of loss. The individuals who raised them—who held them as a child, who guided them through life's challenges, who celebrated their achievements—those specific people will merge into the collective.

Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, and Sage approach their transcendence with the grace that has characterized their lives. They have lived fully, loved deeply, and contributed meaningfully. They have raised three children—Kael, Calista, and Lyra—who have raised their own families. They have seen the cycle continue. They are ready.

For Calista, this period is profound. She finds herself oscillating between grief for what she will lose and peace about where her parents are going. The dreamlike experiences she has begun having—messages from within Lumen—hint at what awaits them all.

Time with her parents becomes more precious. Conversations carry more weight. Old memories are revisited, new ones are made. Calista helps prepare for the ceremony, learning the traditions she will one day follow herself.
