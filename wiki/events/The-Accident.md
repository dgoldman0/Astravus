## Description

Life has a way of introducing unforeseen tragedies. During their routine research expedition to a nearby moon, an unexpected malfunction caused a catastrophic accident. Despite the rescue teams' best efforts, Joren did not survive.

### The Impact on the Community

In the Astraviin world, where transcendence and joining with one's Astravus was the norm, death—especially among the young—was nearly unheard of. Joren's loss was profoundly shocking and unbearably painful. It was as if a piece of Lumen itself had been torn away.

The vibrant energy that once filled the days of Calista and her friends was replaced by a hollow emptiness. The places they had explored together now felt different, empty.

### Calista's Reaction

Calista remembers the moment she found out. The words didn't fully register at first. Her mind refused to accept the possibility.

> "Before the Astraviin, how did people cope when they lived for barely a century? The thought of losing loved ones so frequently, living with the constant presence of death, seemed unbearable. Were people just numb to the loss?"

Cassia and Calista clung to each other, their shared grief a heavy, suffocating presence. Lyra, too young to fully comprehend the permanence of death, was confused and frightened by the sorrow that enveloped their home.

### The Treehouse After

The treehouse, once a place of joy and adventure, stood as a silent reminder of what they had lost.
