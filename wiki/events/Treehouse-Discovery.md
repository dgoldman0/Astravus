## Description

One of the children's favorite places to explore was an old treehouse nestled in the far corner of Maia's garden. The treehouse was built high among the sturdy branches of an ancient oak, its thick canopy providing a natural roof that shaded them from the artificial sunlight streaks above.

The structure itself was a patchwork of different woods, each piece telling a story of repairs and additions made over the years. Its wooden planks, worn smooth by years of use, creaked under their weight as they climbed up to their hidden sanctuary.

### The Treehouse Structure

**Upper Level (Main Floor):**
- Accessed via an old ladder
- Walls adorned with children's drawings and maps of imagined worlds
- Corners filled with cushions and blankets for comfort
- Small chests and boxes holding treasures: smooth stones, colorful feathers, trinkets
- A small wooden table for planning sessions and games
- Simple cutout windows with fabric scrap curtains

**Lower Level (The Hollow):**
- A secret area beneath the main structure
- Second entrance adding mystery and excitement
- Additional treasures and supplies
- Surrounded by natural and bioluminescent plants

### The Atmosphere

The scent was a mix of earthy wood and faint floral fragrance from the garden below. The space felt magical—a place where reality blurred with imagination. Sometimes it was a pirate ship sailing vast seas, other times a space station for daring missions to distant planets.
