## Description

Calista spent time with residents of various ages, each offering different perspectives on life within Aurora.

### Dara (~150 years old)

Dara spoke about the balancing act of maintaining individuality while becoming more integrated with Aurora:

> **Dara:** "It's a constant dance. Some days, you feel entirely yourself, pursuing your interests and passions. Other days, you're so in tune with Aurora that it feels like you're part of a larger symphony. Both experiences are beautiful, but finding the balance can be challenging."

### Alaric (Age unspecified)

Alaric was deeply involved in Aurora's cultural life, particularly in music and art. He showed Calista a room filled with various instruments, both traditional and newly invented:

> **Alaric:** "Our community thrives on creativity. We're always exploring new ways to express ourselves. Music here is a blend of ancient traditions and innovative sounds. It connects us all, across time and space."

### Liora (Artist)

Liora was an artist whose works adorned many of Aurora's communal spaces. Her sculptures and paintings were a testament to the rich cultural heritage of their community:

> **Liora:** "Art is how I express our shared journey. Each piece tells a story, a moment in time that resonates with us all."

Her work drew from the collective memories and experiences of Aurora, creating pieces that reflected their shared heritage.
