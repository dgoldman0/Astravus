## Description

Joren's family had a strong tradition of exploration and innovation. His father Kaleb was an explorer who often ventured on missions to uncover new knowledge and resources. His mother Soren was an Emergency Response and Safety Systems Designer who had designed many of the systems that kept Lumen running smoothly.

One fateful day, Joren and his family embarked on what was meant to be a routine research expedition to a nearby moon. Such missions were normal for their family—Kaleb regularly brought back fascinating stories and artifacts from his travels. Joren had been looking forward to this adventure, eager to experience the thrill of exploration firsthand.

The departure was like many others. Friends and community members saw them off. Calista and Cassia likely wished Joren safe travels, expecting him to return with exciting stories of his adventure.

No one anticipated what would happen next.
