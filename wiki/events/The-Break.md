## Description

As time passed, Calista and Lysandra began to face more significant challenges. Their interests started to diverge:

- Calista's focus on art sometimes made Lysandra feel unappreciated
- The spark that had once brought them together started to dim
- Frequent disagreements and misunderstandings replaced easy connection

One day, after a particularly heated argument about their future plans, they decided to take a break from each other. It was a painful decision, but they both knew it was necessary.

### The Aftermath

The time apart allowed both to reflect on their relationship and what they truly wanted from life. Calista threw herself into her art, using it as a way to cope with the pain of separation. She created some of her best work during this time, channeling her emotions into every brushstroke and sculpture.

Cassia was a constant source of support during this period, encouraging Calista to express herself and reminding her that it was okay to feel hurt and confused.
