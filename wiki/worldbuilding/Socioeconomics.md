# Socioeconomics: Guilds, Households, and Commerce

## Overview

The economy of the Astraviin is not a single unified system but a living mesh of interconnected institutions—**guilds** and **households**—that produce, trade, and coordinate resources through narrow currencies, barter, and mutual obligation. This structure evolved from humanity's distant past and continues to shape daily life within the Astravii.

## The Two Pillars

### Guilds

A **guild** is a member-owned cooperative organized around a craft, trade, discipline, or practice. Guilds are not employers or corporations—they are communities of practitioners who share:

- **Skill Preservation**: Maintaining the knowledge and techniques of their craft across centuries
- **Talent Development**: Training apprentices and journeyfolk, certifying competence
- **Frontier Pushing**: Research, experimentation, and innovation at the edges of what's possible
- **Community Sustenance**: Supporting members through lean periods, pooling resources for major projects

#### Guild Examples in Lumen

| Guild | Focus | Products/Services |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Lattice Technicians** | Living infrastructure maintenance | Structural rebalancing, growth guidance, strain distribution |
| **Acoustic Architects** | Soundscape design | Room acoustics, ambient environments, sonic healing spaces |
| **Textile Weavers** | Fabrics and garments | Clothing, blankets, ceremonial textiles |
| **Botanical Engineers** | Ecological systems | Gardens, atmospheric processing, food cultivation |
| **Fermentation Collective** | Foods and beverages | Wines, cheeses, preserved foods, specialty cultures |
| **Biomedical Practitioners** | Health and healing | Medical care, wellness support, regenerative treatments |
| **Memory Keepers** | Oral history and archives | Story preservation, testimony recording, ceremonial narration |
| **Ceramic Artists** | Pottery and vessels | Functional ware, decorative pieces, ceremonial objects |

#### Guild Organization

Each guild maintains:

- **Workshops and Studios**: Shared production spaces with specialized tooling
- **Archives**: Accumulated knowledge, techniques, and historical records
- **Training Programs**: Structured paths from novice to master
- **Quality Standards**: Certification and peer review systems
- **Resource Pools**: Shared materials, equipment, and emergency funds
- **Representation**: Voice in community coordination and resource allocation

### Households

A **household** in Astraviin society is more than a family—it is a durable socioeconomic unit that functions as both home and enterprise. Households:

- Include friends, family, elders, apprentices, partners, and dependents
- May span multiple residences linked by shared resources
- Maintain internal governance and decision-making structures
- Operate production capacity appropriate to their members' skills

#### Household Production

Many households engage in small-scale production:

- **Gardens**: Fresh produce, herbs, specialty crops
- **Kitchens**: Prepared foods, preserves, baked goods
- **Studios**: Art, crafts, repair services
- **Care Services**: Childcare, elder support, wellness practices

#### Household Commerce

Households trade with each other and with guilds:

- Surplus garden produce for textile goods
- Prepared meals for repair services
- Childcare time-sharing arrangements
- Skill exchanges and apprenticeship hosting

## Currency and Exchange

### Narrow Currencies

Rather than a single universal currency, Lumen operates on multiple **narrow currencies**—tokens of exchange that circulate within and between specific domains:

| Currency Type | Issued By | Used For |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Guild Scrip** | Individual guilds | Intra-guild transactions, member benefits |
| **Barter Tokens** | Community coordination | Balancing asymmetric trades |
| **Time Credits** | Households/Guilds | Labor exchanges, especially for care work |
| **Material Chits** | Resource coordinators | Access to scarce materials (rare minerals, specialty compounds) |
| **Energy Allocations** | Astravus systems | Major production requiring significant power |

### How Trade Works

**Example: A Household Acquiring a New Blanket**

1. The household offers surplus garden herbs to the Textile Weavers Guild
2. The guild values the herbs at 12 barter tokens
3. A master weaver has a blanket valued at 20 tokens
4. The household adds 8 time credits (earned from childcare services) to complete the exchange
5. The weaver receives both herbs (for personal use) and time credits (redeemable for future services)

**Example: A Guild Acquiring Specialized Equipment**

1. The Ceramic Artists Guild needs a new kiln component
2. They approach the Lattice Technicians, who can grow the necessary bio-interface
3. The Ceramicists offer 50 units of guild scrip (redeemable for pottery at member rates)
4. They add a commitment: two ceramic artists will teach a workshop for the Technicians' children
5. The exchange is recorded in both guilds' ledgers

### Balancing Resources

Narrow currencies prevent resource hoarding and encourage circulation:

- Currencies expire or decay if unused too long
- Certain currencies can only be spent within specific domains
- Major imbalances trigger community review and reallocation
- The Astravus itself moderates extreme concentrations through subtle environmental influence

## Guild-Household Interactions

### Membership Flows

- **Guild members live in households**: A person might be a master in the Fermentation Collective while living in a household with an acoustic architect, a caregiver, and two children
- **Households supply guilds**: Young people often apprentice in guilds their household has relationships with
- **Guilds support households**: Members' households receive preferential access to guild products and services

### The Weekly Markets

Regular market gatherings bring guilds and households together:

- **Central Plaza Markets**: Weekly general markets where guilds display wares and households offer surplus
- **Specialty Exchanges**: Periodic markets for specific goods (textiles, ceramics, preserved foods)
- **Skill Fairs**: Events where guilds recruit apprentices and households seek specific expertise

### Ceremonial Exchange

Major life events involve formalized exchange:

- **Constellation Formation**: Gifts flow between households, establishing new trade relationships
- **First Breath**: The community contributes goods to the new child's household
- **Transcendence**: The transcending individual's guild and household distribute their accumulated resources

---

## Resource Coordination

### Community-Level Coordination

Certain resources require coordination beyond bilateral guild-household exchange:

- **Energy**: The Astravus allocates power based on demonstrated need and community priorities
- **Space**: Workshops, gardens, and living spaces are assigned through community consensus
- **Rare Materials**: Specialty compounds, imported goods, and scarce elements require community-level arbitration

### The Coordination Roles

Individuals like **Sol** (Resource Coordinator and Logistics Specialist) serve as facilitators:

- Tracking resource flows and identifying imbalances
- Mediating disputes between guilds or households
- Proposing reallocation when patterns shift
- Maintaining the ledgers and exchange records

### The Astravus's Role

Lumen itself participates in economic life:

- Grows resources where they're needed (plants, materials, structures)
- Signals abundance and scarcity through environmental cues
- Moderates extreme accumulation through subtle pressure
- Integrates transcended economists and coordinators who continue advising from within

## Values and Philosophy

### Not Accumulation but Flow

Wealth in Astraviin society is measured not by what you hold but by what flows through you:

- A wealthy household is one that gives and receives abundantly
- A successful guild is one whose products are widely used and valued
- Hoarding is seen as a kind of illness—resources stagnating rather than circulating

### Not Competition but Craft

Guilds do not compete for market share—they compete for excellence:

- Reputation flows to those who produce the finest work
- Imitation is considered flattery; innovation is shared freely
- Guild boundaries are permeable; cross-guild collaboration is celebrated

### Not Scarcity but Sufficiency

The Astravii produce abundance for basic needs:

- Food, shelter, warmth, and care are never denied
- Currency systems govern access to luxuries, specialties, and craft goods
- No one goes without; many choose to live simply by preference

## Practical Life

### A Day in the Economy

**Morning**: A household member stops at the weekly market, trading preserved vegetables for fresh bread from another household. They pick up a repaired tool from the Lattice Technicians, settling the balance with time credits.

**Midday**: A guild meeting discusses a major project requiring materials from three other guilds. Representatives negotiate terms: shared credits, workshop access, and a collaborative exhibition.

**Evening**: A family celebration draws gifts from multiple sources—a blanket from the textile guild, ceramics from a neighboring household, a song composed by a friend in the Acoustic Architects. The flow of gifts strengthens the web of relationships.

### Tensions and Negotiations

The system is not frictionless:

- Guilds sometimes dispute who has jurisdiction over new practices
- Households occasionally accumulate too much and face gentle community pressure
- Apprentices may chafe under guild hierarchy before earning full membership
- Rare materials create genuine competition and require careful arbitration

But these tensions are managed through centuries of practice, the steady influence of transcended wisdom, and the fundamental abundance that the Astravii provide.

## Relationship to Constellations

Constellations (family units) are a specialized form of household:

- They share the economic functions of households
- They add the specific commitment to raising children
- They often include members from multiple guilds, creating natural trade networks
- The formation of a constellation typically triggers new economic relationships

See [Constellations.md](./Constellations.md) for details on family structure.

---

## Historical Continuity

The guild-household system evolved from Earth's 21st-century transformation:

- Guilds emerged as automation shifted bottlenecks to human expertise
- Households expanded as longevity required durable social-economic cells
- Narrow currencies prevented the capture of resources by eternal elites
- The Astravii inherited and refined these institutions across millennia

See [Distant-Past.md](./Distant-Past.md) for the historical origins.

## Summary

The Astraviin economy is:

| Characteristic | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Distributed** | No central authority controls production or distribution |
| **Relational** | Exchange is embedded in ongoing relationships |
| **Specialized** | Guilds develop deep expertise; households provide generalist support |
| **Circulatory** | Value flows rather than accumulates |
| **Abundant** | Basic needs are guaranteed; currencies govern access to craft and luxury |
| **Participatory** | Everyone is both producer and consumer through their guild and household |

This creates a society where commerce is real and robust—people trade, negotiate, and build—but where the purpose of economic life is the flourishing of craft, community, and care rather than the accumulation of abstract wealth.
