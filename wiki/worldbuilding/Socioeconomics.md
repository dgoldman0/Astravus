# Socioeconomics: Guilds, Households, and Commerce

## Overview

The economy of the Astraviin is not a single unified system but a living mesh of interconnected institutions—**guilds** and **households**—that produce, trade, and coordinate resources through narrow currencies, barter, and mutual obligation. This structure evolved from humanity's distant past and continues to shape daily life within the Astravii.

## The Two Pillars

### Guilds

A **guild** is a member-owned cooperative organized around a craft, trade, discipline, or practice. Guilds are not employers or corporations—they are communities of practitioners who share:

- **Skill Preservation**: Maintaining the knowledge and techniques of their craft across centuries
- **Talent Development**: Training apprentices and journeyfolk, certifying competence
- **Frontier Pushing**: Research, experimentation, and innovation at the edges of what's possible
- **Community Sustenance**: Supporting members through lean periods, pooling resources for major projects

#### Guild Examples in Lumen

| Guild | Focus | Products/Services |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Lattice Technicians** | Living infrastructure maintenance | Structural rebalancing, growth guidance, strain distribution |
| **Acoustic Architects** | Soundscape design | Room acoustics, ambient environments, sonic healing spaces |
| **Textile Weavers** | Fabrics and garments | Clothing, blankets, ceremonial textiles |
| **Botanical Engineers** | Ecological systems | Gardens, atmospheric processing, food cultivation |
| **Fermentation Collective** | Foods and beverages | Wines, cheeses, preserved foods, specialty cultures |
| **Biomedical Practitioners** | Health and healing | Medical care, wellness support, regenerative treatments |
| **Memory Keepers** | Oral history and archives | Story preservation, testimony recording, ceremonial narration |
| **Ceramic Artists** | Pottery and vessels | Functional ware, decorative pieces, ceremonial objects |

#### Guild Organization

Each guild maintains:

- **Workshops and Studios**: Shared production spaces with specialized tooling
- **Archives**: Accumulated knowledge, techniques, and historical records
- **Training Programs**: Structured paths from novice to master
- **Quality Standards**: Certification and peer review systems
- **Resource Pools**: Shared materials, equipment, and emergency funds
- **Representation**: Voice in community coordination and resource allocation

### Households

A **household** in Astraviin society is more than a family—it is a durable socioeconomic unit that functions as both home and enterprise. Households:

- Include friends, family, elders, apprentices, partners, and dependents
- May span multiple residences linked by shared resources
- Maintain internal governance and decision-making structures
- Operate production capacity appropriate to their members' skills

#### Household Production

Many households engage in small-scale production:

- **Gardens**: Fresh produce, herbs, specialty crops
- **Kitchens**: Prepared foods, preserves, baked goods
- **Studios**: Art, crafts, repair services
- **Care Services**: Childcare, elder support, wellness practices

#### Household Commerce

Households trade with each other and with guilds:

- Surplus garden produce for textile goods
- Prepared meals for repair services
- Childcare time-sharing arrangements
- Skill exchanges and apprenticeship hosting

## Currency and Exchange

### The Currency Hierarchy

Rather than a single universal currency, Astraviin society operates on a hierarchy of **narrow currencies**—each serving a specific scope and purpose. This layered system prevents resource hoarding, encourages circulation, and keeps economic power distributed.

#### Tier 1: Universal Energy Standard

**Sparks (◇)**
- Pegged to actual energy allocation from the Astravus
- The universal baseline accepted everywhere
- Used for major infrastructure, rare materials, and inter-Astravii settlement
- Symbol: ◇ (e.g., "◇50" or "fifty sparks")

#### Tier 2: Inter-Astravii Currency

**Bonds (∞)**
- Shared currency between Astravii populations (Lumen, Aurora, Nyx, and others)
- Used by travelers, explorers, and for inter-community trade
- Backed by mutual agreements between Astravii collectives
- Symbol: ∞ (e.g., "∞20" or "twenty bonds")

#### Tier 3: Local Currency

**Rays (☼)**
- Lumen's everyday local currency
- Used for most transactions between households and guilds
- Issued by Lumen's coordination systems, backed by community production
- Symbol: ☼ (e.g., "☼100" or "a hundred rays")

#### Tier 4: Guild Currencies

Each guild issues its own scrip, valuable within that guild's domain and convertible to Rays at guild-set rates:

| Guild | Currency Name | Symbol | Notes |
|-------|--------------|--------|-------|
| Textile Weavers | Threads | ⊤ | Redeemable for guild textiles at member rates |
| Ceramic Artists | Rounds | ○ | Preferred for pottery and restoration |
| Acoustic Architects | Notes | ♪ | Good for soundscape consultations |
| Lattice Technicians | Bonds | ⌇ | Infrastructure and maintenance services |
| Fermentation Collective | Cultures | ⌘ | Specialty foods and beverages |
| Botanical Engineers | Seeds | ❋ | Garden design and ecological services |

#### Tier 5: Household Accounts

Each household maintains internal accounts tracking:
- Member contributions and draws
- Outstanding obligations to other households
- Accumulated guild currencies and Rays
- Time commitments (care hours, shared duties)

Household accounts don't circulate externally—they're internal bookkeeping that determines what the household can spend.

### Why Not Direct Barter?

Direct barter creates problems:
- **Double coincidence of wants**: You need someone who has what you want AND wants what you have
- **Valuation disputes**: Every trade requires negotiating relative worth
- **No accumulation for major purchases**: Hard to save for something expensive
- **Relationship strain**: Negotiating with neighbors breeds resentment

Currencies solve these problems by providing:
- **Intermediation**: Sell honey to anyone, buy blankets from anyone
- **Standard pricing**: Goods have known values in Rays
- **Savings**: Accumulate Rays for major household purchases
- **Clean transactions**: The currency handles the math; relationships stay warm

### How Trade Actually Works

**Example: A Household Buying a Blanket**

1. Household Vesper sells honey at market, receiving ☼80 in Rays
2. They also hold ⊤15 in Weaver Threads from a previous transaction
3. The ceremonial blanket is priced at ☼60 or equivalent
4. They pay ☼45 plus ⊤15 (Threads convert at favorable rates within the guild)
5. Transaction complete—no negotiation of relative worth, no bartering

**Example: Guild-to-Guild Transaction**

1. Ceramic Artists need a new kiln interface from Lattice Technicians
2. Listed price: ◇30 (sparks, because it requires significant energy allocation)
3. Ceramicists pay from their guild's Spark reserves
4. If short on Sparks, they can convert Rays at the current exchange rate
5. No need to find a Lattice Technician who wants pottery

### Currency Exchange

Currencies convert through established rates maintained by coordination systems:

- **Guild scrip → Rays**: Each guild sets its own rate (typically favorable for members)
- **Rays → Sparks**: Floating rate based on energy availability
- **Rays → Bonds**: Fixed inter-Astravii exchange agreements
- **Household accounts → Rays**: Households draw from accumulated balances

Exchange happens automatically through ledger systems—no need to visit a money changer.

### Currency Decay and Circulation

To prevent hoarding:
- **Guild scrip** expires if unused (typically 1-2 years)
- **Rays** lose small value over time (demurrage), encouraging spending
- **Sparks** are stable but monitored—large accumulations trigger review
- **Bonds** are the most stable, designed for long-term inter-Astravii obligations

### Prices and Everyday Life

Common price references in Rays (☼):

| Item | Typical Price |
|------|---------------|
| Loaf of artisan bread | ☼2-3 |
| Jar of specialty honey | ☼5-8 |
| Standard clothing | ☼15-30 |
| Ceremonial blanket | ☼50-80 |
| Ceramic restoration | ☼10-20 (materials) |
| Soundscape consultation | ♪10 or ☼25 |
| Care hour (childcare, elder support) | ☼4-6 |

## Guild-Household Interactions

### Membership Flows

- **Guild members live in households**: A person might be a master in the Fermentation Collective while living in a household with an acoustic architect, a caregiver, and two children
- **Households supply guilds**: Young people often apprentice in guilds their household has relationships with
- **Guilds support households**: Members' households receive preferential access to guild products and services

### The Weekly Markets

Regular market gatherings bring guilds and households together:

- **Central Plaza Markets**: Weekly general markets where guilds display wares and households offer surplus
- **Specialty Exchanges**: Periodic markets for specific goods (textiles, ceramics, preserved foods)
- **Skill Fairs**: Events where guilds recruit apprentices and households seek specific expertise

### Ceremonial Exchange

Major life events involve formalized exchange:

- **Constellation Formation**: Gifts flow between households, establishing new trade relationships
- **First Breath**: The community contributes goods to the new child's household
- **Transcendence**: The transcending individual's guild and household distribute their accumulated resources

---

## Resource Coordination

### Community-Level Coordination

Certain resources require coordination beyond bilateral guild-household exchange:

- **Energy**: The Astravus allocates power based on demonstrated need and community priorities
- **Space**: Workshops, gardens, and living spaces are assigned through community consensus
- **Rare Materials**: Specialty compounds, imported goods, and scarce elements require community-level arbitration

### The Coordination Roles

Individuals like **Sol** (Resource Coordinator and Logistics Specialist) serve as facilitators:

- Tracking resource flows and identifying imbalances
- Mediating disputes between guilds or households
- Proposing reallocation when patterns shift
- Maintaining the ledgers and exchange records

### The Astravus's Role

Lumen itself participates in economic life:

- Grows resources where they're needed (plants, materials, structures)
- Signals abundance and scarcity through environmental cues
- Moderates extreme accumulation through subtle pressure
- Integrates transcended economists and coordinators who continue advising from within

---

## Values and Philosophy

### Not Accumulation but Flow

Wealth in Astraviin society is measured not by what you hold but by what flows through you:

- A wealthy household is one that gives and receives abundantly
- A successful guild is one whose products are widely used and valued
- Hoarding is seen as a kind of illness—resources stagnating rather than circulating

### Not Competition but Craft

Guilds do not compete for market share—they compete for excellence:

- Reputation flows to those who produce the finest work
- Imitation is considered flattery; innovation is shared freely
- Guild boundaries are permeable; cross-guild collaboration is celebrated

### Not Scarcity but Sufficiency

The Astravii produce abundance for basic needs:

- Food, shelter, warmth, and care are never denied
- Currency systems govern access to luxuries, specialties, and craft goods
- No one goes without; many choose to live simply by preference

---

## Automation and Human Focus

### The Division of Labor

A critical feature of Astraviin economics is the sharp division between **routine production** and **creative direction**:

- **Automation handles the mechanical**: Once something is designed, understood, and specified, automated systems—integrated into the Astravus itself—handle replication, maintenance, and routine production
- **People handle the innovative**: Design, direction-setting, experimentation, teaching, and the irreducibly human aspects of craft remain with guild members and households

### What Automation Does

| Domain | Automated | Human-Directed |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Textiles** | Spinning thread, basic weaving patterns | New designs, color selection, ceremonial pieces |
| **Ceramics** | Clay preparation, standard forms | Glazes, artistic pieces, restoration work |
| **Food** | Basic cultivation, harvesting, processing | Recipe development, fermentation cultures, specialty items |
| **Infrastructure** | Routine maintenance, standard growth | Rebalancing, troubleshooting, new construction |
| **Medicine** | Diagnostics, standard treatments | Complex cases, research, wellness counseling |

### Why This Matters

Automation frees people to:

- **Pursue mastery**: Spend time on the edges of their craft rather than repetitive production
- **Teach and mentor**: Pass knowledge to the next generation without production pressure
- **Experiment**: Try new approaches without risking essential supply
- **Live fully**: Dedicate time to relationships, art, play, and contemplation

### Guild Relationship to Automation

Guilds do not own or control automation—the Astravus provides it as infrastructure. Guild members:

- Set specifications and quality standards that automation follows
- Monitor output and adjust parameters
- Handle everything automation cannot: judgment, creativity, interpersonal connection
- Train the systems when new techniques are developed

This means a master weaver might design a new pattern, teach it to the looms, then spend her time on one-of-a-kind ceremonial pieces while the looms produce everyday cloth. An apprentice learns both the craft itself and how to direct the automated systems that amplify it.

## Practical Life

### A Day in the Economy

**Morning**: A household member stops at the weekly market, trading preserved vegetables for fresh bread from another household. They pick up a repaired tool from the Lattice Technicians, settling the balance with time credits.

**Midday**: A guild meeting discusses a major project requiring materials from three other guilds. Representatives negotiate terms: shared credits, workshop access, and a collaborative exhibition.

**Evening**: A family celebration draws gifts from multiple sources—a blanket from the textile guild, ceramics from a neighboring household, a song composed by a friend in the Acoustic Architects. The flow of gifts strengthens the web of relationships.

### Tensions and Negotiations

The system is not frictionless:

- Guilds sometimes dispute who has jurisdiction over new practices
- Households occasionally accumulate too much and face gentle community pressure
- Apprentices may chafe under guild hierarchy before earning full membership
- Rare materials create genuine competition and require careful arbitration

But these tensions are managed through centuries of practice, the steady influence of transcended wisdom, and the fundamental abundance that the Astravii provide.

---

## Relationship to Constellations

Constellations (family units) are a specialized form of household:

- They share the economic functions of households
- They add the specific commitment to raising children
- They often include members from multiple guilds, creating natural trade networks
- The formation of a constellation typically triggers new economic relationships

See [Constellations.md](./Constellations.md) for details on family structure.

---

## Historical Continuity

The guild-household system evolved from Earth's 21st-century transformation:

- Guilds emerged as automation shifted bottlenecks to human expertise
- Households expanded as longevity required durable social-economic cells
- Narrow currencies prevented the capture of resources by eternal elites
- The Astravii inherited and refined these institutions across millennia

See [Distant-Past.md](./Distant-Past.md) for the historical origins.

## Summary

The Astraviin economy is:

| Characteristic | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Distributed** | No central authority controls production or distribution |
| **Relational** | Exchange is embedded in ongoing relationships |
| **Specialized** | Guilds develop deep expertise; households provide generalist support |
| **Circulatory** | Value flows rather than accumulates |
| **Abundant** | Basic needs are guaranteed; currencies govern access to craft and luxury |
| **Participatory** | Everyone is both producer and consumer through their guild and household |

This creates a society where commerce is real and robust—people trade, negotiate, and build—but where the purpose of economic life is the flourishing of craft, community, and care rather than the accumulation of abstract wealth.
