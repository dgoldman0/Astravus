### Training Data Format
- **Seven-turn conversation**: Fragment number query → Number response → Exact text query → Text response → Significance query → Analysis response
- **Every turn names the fragment explicitly** for reinforcement
- **Total entries in core.jsonl**: 237 fragments
- **Sparse sampling**: Covers Book I through Book IV with ~3-15 fragment gaps
- **Batch size**: 15 fragments per batch (increased from 8 for efficiency)

### Next Batch (Batch 21 - 15 fragments)
- Continue sparse coverage of remaining 39 fragments
- Focus on Book IV transcendence dreams and final integration
- Suggested: 224, 226, 227, 229, 231, 232, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 241, 242, 243

## Continuation Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Quick reference to restart batch processing without re-reading conversation or prior context.

### Current Status Summary
- **Total Fragments in Arc**: 276 (from latest.md analysis)
- **Completed Fragments**: 237 (85.9% coverage)
- **Remaining Fragments**: 39 (14.1%)
- **Current File**: `core.jsonl` at `/voxservice_training/training_data/core/`
- **Fragment Index**: This file (`FRAGMENTS.md`)
- **Source Text**: `revision/latest.md`

### Completed Fragment Numbers
1-223 (continuous), 225, 228, 230, 233, 240, 245, 250, 252, 255, 260, 265, 268, 270, 272

- Fragment 166 (Formation ceremony)
- Fragment 199 (Garden conversation with mother)
- Fragment 236 (Aris's dream of Selene)

### JSONL Format (7 messages per entry)
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": ""},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the fragment number for the Astravus Collection: Calista Arc fragment \"{FRAGMENT_NAME}\"?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fragment #{NUM}: \"{FRAGMENT_NAME}\""},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Give the exact text of the Astravus Collection: Calista Arc's \"{FRAGMENT_NAME}\" fragment."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "{EXACT_TEXT_FROM_LATEST.MD}"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How does the \"{FRAGMENT_NAME}\" fragment relate to the rest of the Calista Arc and the broader Astravus Collection?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "{MARKDOWN_ANALYSIS}"}
  ]
}
```

### Key Requirements
- **Fragment names must be referenced by name in every user query** (for token efficiency and reinforcement)
- **Sort entries by fragment number** after each batch
- **Exact text extraction** from `latest.md` without modification
- **Rich markdown analysis** connecting fragment to broader Arc themes and Collection principles
- **15 fragments per batch** for faster processing (increased from 8 as of Batch 10)

### Processing Workflow for Next Batch
1. Select 15 fragments from "Next Suggested Batch" or sparse coverage pattern
2. Extract exact text from `latest.md` with line references
3. Create markdown analysis connecting to Arc themes (minimum 500 characters per analysis)
4. Build 7-message JSONL entries with proper formatting
5. Merge with existing `core.jsonl` entries
6. Sort all entries by fragment number
7. Update FRAGMENTS.md completed list and increment progress
8. Verify sort order: `json.loads(line)['messages'][1]['content']` contains fragment name/number
