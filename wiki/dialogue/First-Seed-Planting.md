# First Seed Planting

## Context
One of Calista's earliest memories in Maia's garden. This moment establishes Maia's teaching style—her gentle patience, her habit of speaking to plants as if they were old friends, and her belief that growing things mirrors growing people. These themes echo throughout Calista's life.

## Participants
- **Maia** - Botanist parent, warm and gentle, speaks to plants directly
- **Calista** - Young child, curious and eager to learn, already showing artistic observation

## Dialogue

*The morning light filtered through the crystal dome above Maia's garden, casting prisms across the dark soil. Maia knelt beside a freshly turned bed, her fingers trailing through the earth with practiced ease. Young Calista watched, fascinated by the way her mother's hands moved—always touching, always connected to growing things.*

**Maia:** *(holding up a small seed, turning it in the light)* "Do you see this, little one? Inside this tiny shell sleeps a whole sunflower, tall and golden, waiting to wake up."

*She pressed the seed gently into Calista's palm and closed her small fingers around it.*

**Calista:** "It's so small. How does a whole flower fit inside?"

**Maia:** *(her voice soft and warm, like sun on leaves)* "The same way you fit inside when you were just a seed yourself. Everything you'll ever become is already there, waiting for the right light, the right soil, the right time."

*Together, they dug a small hole in the rich, dark earth. Maia's hands guided Calista's, showing her how to feel the depth, the moisture, the promise in the ground beneath them.*

**Maia:** *(to the seed, as Calista nestled it into the soil)* "There you go, little dreamer. Sleep well. We'll be here when you wake."

*Calista giggled at her mother talking to a seed.*

**Calista:** "Can it hear you?"

**Maia:** *(smiling, patting the earth down gently)* "Everything listens in its own way, Cali. The plants, the earth, even the air. And when we speak kindly to growing things, they grow kindly in return."

*She brushed dirt from her hands and cupped Calista's cheeks, leaving faint traces of soil on her skin.*

**Maia:** "Remember—plants need love and patience. Just like people. Just like you."

*Calista looked down at the tiny mound of earth, already imagining the golden flower that would one day stretch toward the dome.*

**Calista:** "I want to paint it. The flower. When it wakes up."

*Maia's eyes crinkled with warmth.*

**Maia:** "Then you shall. And I'll save you a seed from that flower, so you can plant another, and paint that one too. On and on, forever growing."
