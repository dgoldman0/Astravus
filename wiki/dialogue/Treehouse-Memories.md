# Treehouse Memories and Promises

## Context
Various moments in the childhood treehouse that capture the bond between Calista, Cassia, and Joren—and later, the preservation of Joren's memory.

## Participants
- **Joren** - Childhood friend, adventurous spirit
- **Cassia** - Childhood friend, storyteller
- **Calista** - Protagonist

## The Treehouse's Significance

**Joren:** "Remember the first time we climbed up here? You were so scared, Cali, but look at you now!"

**Calista:** "I wasn't that scared. But yes, I remember. It feels like we've had a hundred adventures up here since then."

## The Promise

**Cassia:** "Do you think we'll ever outgrow this place?"

**Joren:** "Never. This is our sanctuary. It'll always be special. And we'll always meet here, no matter how old we get."

## Rainy Day Stories

*On rainy days, the sound of raindrops pattering against the wooden roof created a soothing rhythm.*

**Cassia:** "Imagine a world where the trees can talk. What would they say?"

**Joren:** "I bet they'd tell us about all the things they've seen. Maybe they'd even share secrets we could use on our next adventure."

## Imaginative Play

**Joren:** "Today, we're explorers on a distant planet. Cassia, you chart the new terrain. Cali, you're in charge of finding any alien life forms."

**Cassia and Calista:** "Yes, Captain!"

## After Joren's Death

*Later, Cassia and Calista continued to visit the treehouse, now a sacred space for remembrance.*

**Cassia:** "I think Joren would have loved this. He always loved going on adventures."

**Calista:** "Yeah, he would. Let's draw one of our favorite adventures with him, to keep his spirit alive."
