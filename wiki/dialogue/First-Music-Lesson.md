# First Music Lesson

## Context
An evening in Selene's music room where she introduces young Calista to the flute. This establishes Selene's belief that music speaks directly to the heart—and reveals her unique way of experiencing sound as color, emotion, and physical sensation. Her teaching style flows like melody itself: more humming than speaking, more feeling than instruction.

## Participants
- **Selene** - Musician parent, graceful and synesthetic, hums between words
- **Calista** - Child, initially uncertain but gaining confidence

## Dialogue

*The music room glowed with the amber light of evening, shadows pooling soft and warm in the corners. Selene sat at the piano, her fingers resting lightly on the keys—not playing, just touching, as if greeting old friends. She hummed a soft, wandering melody, the notes drifting through the air like pollen.*

*Calista stood in the doorway, drawn by the sound but hesitant to enter.*

**Selene:** *(not turning, her voice soft and melodic)* "Mmm-hmm... Come sit with me, Cali."

*She patted the space beside her on the piano bench, still humming. Calista padded over, sitting close enough to feel the warmth of her mother's presence.*

*Selene reached to a stand nearby and lifted a small silver flute, turning it in the light so it caught the amber glow.*

**Selene:** *(almost singing the words)* "Do you see how it shines? Music lives inside, waiting to wake up. Like a dream that hasn't been dreamed yet."

*She placed the flute gently in Calista's hands.*

**Calista:** *(holding it carefully)* "It's cold."

**Selene:** *(smiling)* "Mmm. It will warm as you play. The music will warm it. And you."

*She guided Calista's fingers to the keys, then leaned back, humming softly—a simple melody, three notes rising and falling like breath.*

**Selene:** "Try this. Just breathe into it. Let the sound find its own shape."

*Calista took a deep breath and blew. The note that emerged was thin, wobbly, uncertain—but Selene's eyes lit up as if she'd heard a symphony.*

**Selene:** *(her voice hushed with wonder)* "There. Do you feel it? That color?"

**Calista:** *(confused)* "Color?"

*Selene hummed again, her eyes half-closed.*

**Selene:** "When I hear music, I see colors. That note you played—it was pale blue, like morning sky. A little shy, a little soft. But beautiful."

*Calista tried again. The note was steadier this time.*

**Selene:** *(nodding, humming along)* "Mmm, yes... brighter now. Like sunlight touching water."

*She began to play softly on the piano, weaving gentle harmonies around Calista's hesitant notes. The two melodies braided together—one practiced and flowing, one new and searching.*

**Selene:** "Music speaks to the heart, little one. You don't have to know the words. You just have to listen—and let yourself feel what the sounds are saying."

**Calista:** *(lowering the flute, eyes wide)* "Does everyone hear colors like you do?"

*Selene smiled, a dreaming expression crossing her face.*

**Selene:** "Not everyone. But everyone hears *something*. Some hear stories. Some hear memories. Some hear feelings they couldn't put into words." 

*She touched Calista's chest, right over her heart.*

**Selene:** "What does the music say to *you*?"

*Calista thought for a moment, then lifted the flute again.*

**Calista:** "It says... keep trying."

*Selene laughed—a sound like bells—and began to play again, humming beneath the melody, filling the room with color only she could see.*
