## Mosaic Class with Alara

*One afternoon, Calista helped a group of young kids create a mosaic. They sat around a large table, their small hands eagerly sorting through tiles of all shapes and colors.*

**Alara:** "Look! I made a flower!"

**Calista:** "That's beautiful, Alara. Maybe we can add some green tiles for the leaves."

*Alara nodded enthusiastically, and they worked together to complete their section of the mosaic.*

## Pottery Class with Jax

*Another day, she assisted with a pottery class for older students.*

**Calista:** "Try adding a bit more pressure here."

*Jax followed her advice, and their work began to take form.*

**Jax:** "Thanks, Cali! This is so much fun."

**Calista:** "You're doing great, Jax."

## Exhibition Conversation

*During one exhibition, a visitor approached her.*

**Visitor:** "This piece is incredible. It feels like it's alive."

**Calista:** "Thank you. I tried to capture the memory of planting seeds with my family and watching them grow."

*Their conversation delved deeper into the inspirations behind her work, and Calista found herself sharing stories of her early life and her evolving connection with Lumen.*
