## Discussing Transitions

*One afternoon, Elara joined them in the garden.*

**Elara:** "How do you feel about all this?"

*Calista took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her question.*

**Calista:** "It's a mix of emotions. There's a sense of peace, but also the sorrow of letting go. Yet, I know this is a part of our journey."

*Elara listened intently, her eyes reflecting the innocence of youth rather than the wisdom of experience.*

**Elara:** "I just want to make sure you're both okay."

**Aris:** "We are. And we'll always be with you, no matter what."

## The Marketplace Dream

*In another dream during Calista's transition, she found herself in the bustling marketplace of Lumen with Elara.*

**Elara:** "Mom, look at this!"

*She held up a beautifully crafted piece of jewelry.*

**Calista:** "It's beautiful."

*Elara's expression turned serious.*

**Elara:** "I've been thinking a lot about our future. How will I manage without you?"

*Calista pulled her into a hug, the dreamscape around them blurring slightly.*

**Calista:** "You'll always carry us with you, Elara. In your heart and in Lumen."
