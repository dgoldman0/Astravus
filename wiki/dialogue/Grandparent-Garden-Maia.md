# Grandparent Garden with Maia

## Context
Maia continues her role as teacher across generations, now sharing her botanical wisdom with her granddaughter Elara. This scene mirrors Calista's own childhood memories with Maia, while honoring Elara's unique perspective—her analytical mind, her habit of counting and measuring, her way of seeing the world through systems and mechanics. Maia's unchanged warmth, her habit of speaking to plants, and her tradition of giving seeds bridges the generations.

## Participants
- **Maia** - Grandmother, patient teacher, speaks to plants as old friends
- **Elara** - Granddaughter, curious but analytical, counts and measures everything

## Setting
*One sunny afternoon, Maia and Elara knelt together in the garden, surrounded by an array of colorful flowers and lush greenery. The dome above filtered the light into gentle warmth, and the air smelled of earth and growing things. Maia's garden had only grown more elaborate over the years—a living tapestry of blooms and vegetables, each plant known to her by name.*

## Dialogue

*Maia was tending to a row of seedlings, her fingers gentle as she loosened the soil around their roots. Elara sat nearby, her small notebook open, already sketching a diagram of the plant bed's layout.*

**Elara:** *(counting under her breath)* "...seven, eight, nine sunflowers. Grandma Maia, why do some plants need more sunlight than others? Is there a formula?"

*Maia smiled, wiping dirt from her hands with a familiar, graceful motion. She turned to a nearby fern and brushed its fronds gently.*

**Maia:** *(to the fern)* "She wants to know your secrets, little one. Should we tell her?"

*Elara looked up, a small smile playing at her lips. She was used to Grandma Maia talking to plants.*

**Maia:** *(turning back to Elara, voice warm and patient)* "Well, my analytical one, it's because different plants come from different parts of many worlds. Each one has adapted to thrive in its unique environment—some evolved under constant light, like these sunflowers, while others grew beneath forest canopies, like those shade-loving ferns."

*Elara's pencil moved quickly, noting this down.*

**Elara:** "So it's adaptation. Like... like engineering. The plants that survived were the ones built for their environment."

*Maia's eyes crinkled with warmth.*

**Maia:** "Yes! You see it through your own lens, and that's beautiful. Your grandfather Arin would say the same thing—that nature is the oldest engineer."

*She reached into her apron pocket and withdrew a small envelope—seeds, as always.*

**Maia:** *(pressing them into Elara's palm)* "Here. These are from the sunflowers I planted when your mother was your age. They've been growing and re-seeding ever since—generation after generation, like our family."

*Elara held the seeds carefully, turning them over, examining their structure.*

**Elara:** "So they're... connected. To the first ones you planted with Mama?"

**Maia:** "They are. And someday, you might plant these, and your children will plant the seeds from those, and on and on. That's the way of growing things. We're all connected—people and plants alike."

*Maia touched Elara's cheek gently, leaving a faint trace of soil.*

**Elara:** *(looking at the seeds with new wonder)* "Grandma, do you really think the plants can hear you when you talk to them?"

*Maia laughed softly, reaching over to brush a leaf from Elara's hair.*

**Maia:** "I think everything listens in its own way. And whether they hear my words or not, speaking to them reminds *me* to be gentle, to be patient, to treat every growing thing with care."

*She leaned closer, voice conspiratorial.*

**Maia:** "Besides, the sunflowers told me they like you. They said you ask very good questions."

*Elara giggled, then grew thoughtful.*

**Elara:** "Can I name this one?"

*She pointed to a particularly vibrant sunflower seedling.*

**Maia:** *(beaming)* "Of course. Every plant deserves a name. What will you call it?"

**Elara:** *(considering seriously)* "...Unit Seven."

*Maia burst into delighted laughter.*

**Maia:** "Unit Seven it is. I'll make sure to introduce myself properly."
