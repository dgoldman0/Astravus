# Selene

## Basic Information
- **Age:** 125+ years (approaching transcendence by later narrative)
- **Role in Story:** Acoustic Architect, musician, Calista's parent, member of family constellation

## Physical Description
Selene has a graceful, elegant presence and is notably petite—the shortest of the five parents. Her deep bronze skin contrasts strikingly with her pure white hair—premature graying that started at 30, genetic in origin—and her piercing violet eyes are distinctive and memorable. She has extraordinarily long fingers—pianist's hands taken to an extreme—with calluses arranged in distinct patterns from specific instruments. High cheekbones and a narrow face give her an almost ethereal quality. She tends to sway slightly even when standing still, as if always hearing rhythm. Everything about her physical presentation suggests the refined artistry of her acoustic practice.

- Patient and encouraging in teaching, never critical

### Sample Dialogue
- *Teaching music:* "Music speaks to the heart. Don't worry about the notes—feel where your fingers want to go."
- *Comforting through sound:* *(plays a gentle melody rather than speaking, the music saying what words cannot)*
- *Describing emotions:* "This feels like B minor—dignified acceptance. Not sad exactly, but thoughtful."
- *Encouraging Calista:* "Your playing was a little shaky, but I heard what you were reaching for. Let's find it together."

### Non-Verbal Communication

- Keeps instruments by the bedside; composes in dreams, waking the family with 3am music
- Sways slightly even standing still, always hearing rhythm
- Hums specific notes to communicate emotional states; C major for comfortable reunion, B minor for acceptance
- Physical grace translates emotion—her movement reveals feeling

### Musical Communication
