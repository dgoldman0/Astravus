# Arin

## Basic Information
- **Age:** 125+ years (approaching transcendence by later narrative)
- **Role in Story:** Biomechanical Interface Designer, engineer, Calista's parent, member of family constellation
- **Home:** Lumen (the Astravus)
- **Constellation:** 5-member family with Maia, Selene, Dorian, and Sage
- **Children:** Calista (middle child), Kael (older), Lyra (younger)

## Physical Description
Arin has pale, freckled skin that flushes easily when excited about a project. Their short-cropped auburn hair (not quite brown, not quite red) and sharp blue eyes give them an intense, focused appearance. They have a lean build with notably muscular forearms from decades of physical labor, and are of average height—shorter than Maia and Dorian. They are missing the tip of their left pinky finger—a workshop accident decades ago; they declined regeneration because "it reminds me to be careful." Their eyebrows are perpetually slightly singed from close work with heat, and they always have graphite or grease smudges somewhere visible. A network of small scars covers their hands from decades of precise mechanical work. They move with the confidence of someone who truly understands how things work—whether machines or the complexities of daily life.

## Profession & Passion

### As a Biomechanical Interface Designer
Arin specializes in technology that integrates with living systems—plants, Astravus tissue, human enhancement. Not just machines but living-machine hybrids. Their expertise includes:
- Designing interfaces between organic and technological systems
- Creating technology that grows and adapts with living tissue
- Working with Maia on systems that serve botanical needs
- System repair and maintenance for complex bio-tech systems
- Innovative problem-solving at the intersection of biology and engineering
- Designing systems like irrigation technology that serve the broader community

### The Workshop
Arin's workshop is a place of fascination and learning:
- Filled with the metallic scent of machinery

- Creating safe spaces for learning and experimentation

### Key Parenting Moments
- **Teaching from mistakes:** When Calista accidentally knocked over a jar of screws, rather than scolding her, Arin responded: "Mistakes happen, Calista. The important thing is to learn from them." They then guided her through repairing the component, teaching patience and perseverance.
- **Encouraging confidence:** When saying Calista's full name (indicating concern), Arin reassured her that mistakes were actually opportunities to make things better
- **Collaborative learning:** Showing Calista how to use workshop tools and teaching the principles behind mechanical work

### With Extended Family
Arin's professional skills benefit the whole family constellation:
- Working on projects that serve Maia's garden
- Creating devices that improve home functionality
- Teaching mechanical principles to interested family members

## Relationship with Elara

The relationship between Arin and their grandchild Elara becomes particularly significant:
- Elara inherits Arin's tinkering spirit and engineering aptitude
- They spend countless hours together in the workshop
- Arin becomes Elara's primary mentor in engineering
- Their bond strengthens over shared passion for making and fixing things

### Workshop Sessions
In later years, Elara and Arin:
- Work on Elara's prototype interactive light sculptures
- Collaborate on kinetic sculptures that respond to environmental changes
- Demonstrate the intergenerational transmission of knowledge and passion
- Create a legacy of innovation and craftsmanship

### Guidance and Pride
Arin:
- Watches Elara grow into a skilled engineer
- Provides critical feedback and encouragement
- Demonstrates deep pride in Elara's accomplishments
- Continues active mentorship even as transcendence approaches

## Personal Qualities
- **Precise:** Attention to detail in work and thought
- **Patient:** Willing to teach and guide with care
- **Practical:** Focuses on real-world solutions and applications
- **Curious:** Always investigating how things work
- **Confident:** Secure in their knowledge and abilities
- **Generous:** Willing to share skills and knowledge with others

## Quirks
- **Thinks by building:** Cannot work through problems verbally or by thinking alone. Must physically construct something (even small models from scraps) to understand concepts. Dinner table often has little mechanical sculptures they've built while talking.
- **Hums constantly while working:** Not songs, but mechanical rhythms that match whatever they're building. Family can tell what Arin is working on by the humming pattern.
- **Keeps "retired" machines:** Cannot bear to fully dismantle old machines. Has a room of "sleeping" devices they've promised to wake up someday. Talks to them occasionally.
