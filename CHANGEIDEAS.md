# CHANGEIDEAS: Revision Plan for Astravus Calista

This document outlines inconsistencies, gaps, and areas needing revision across the TIMELINE.md, events/, and supporting documents. The bios and CHARACTERS.md are considered authoritative sources (reviewed previously). The prototype document has lowest priority when conflicts arise.

---

## PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL INCONSISTENCIES

These are fundamental errors that create confusion about who characters are and how they relate to each other.

---

### 1.1 LYRA IDENTITY CRISIS - SIBLING VS DAUGHTER

**The Problem:**
Lyra is inconsistently portrayed as two different characters:
- **In CHARACTERS.md & bios/Lyra.md:** Calista's **younger SISTER** (child of the 5-parent constellation with Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, Sage)
- **In events/Lyra-Arrival.md:** Calista and Aris's **second DAUGHTER** (born after Elara)
- **In events/INDEX.md:** Listed under "Parenthood" section as "Lyra's Arrival - Second child arrives"
- **In events/Grandparent-Teaching-Moments.md:** Listed as grandchild alongside Elara
- **In events/Lyras-Adventure-Announcement.md:** Lyra announces to "Calista - Parent" and "Aris - Parent"

**Authoritative Source (CHARACTERS.md/bios):**
Lyra is Calista's **younger sister**, part of the original 5-parent constellation. The prototype and TIMELINE.md also confirm this (Lyra is present in "Early Friendships" alongside Kael, and later becomes an explorer).

**Files Requiring Revision:**
1. `events/Lyra-Arrival.md` - **DELETE or completely rewrite** as Lyra's childhood from Calista's POV
2. `events/INDEX.md` - Remove "Lyra's Arrival" from Parenthood section; Lyra should only appear in childhood/early life sections
3. `events/Grandparent-Teaching-Moments.md` - Remove Lyra as "grandchild"; only Elara should be listed as Calista's child
4. `events/Lyras-Adventure-Announcement.md` - Change "Calista - Parent" to "Calista - Sister" (Lyra is announcing to her sister, not her mother)

**Resolution:**
Calista and Aris have **ONE child: Elara**. Lyra is Calista's younger sister who becomes an explorer.

---

### 1.2 KAEL IDENTITY CRISIS - BROTHER VS PARENT

**The Problem:**
Similar confusion exists with Kael's role:
- **In CHARACTERS.md & bios/Kael.md:** Calista's **older BROTHER** who later forms constellation with Sage and Sol
- **In events/INDEX.md:** Lists "Maia and Kael" as "Calista's parents" and later as "grandparents"
- **In events/Grandparent-Teaching-Moments.md:** "Kael - Grandfather" teaching Elara and Lyra
- **In events/Constellation-Formation.md:** Lists "Maia and Kael - Calista's parents"
- **In events/Elara-First-Breath.md:** "Kael - Grandfather"
- **In events/Kael-Constellation.md:** "Kael, Calista's father, forms constellation..."

**Authoritative Source (CHARACTERS.md/bios):**
- Calista's five PARENTS are: **Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, Sage**
- Kael is Calista's **older BROTHER**
- Kael later forms constellation with Sage (one of the original five parents) and Sol

**Files Requiring Revision:**
1. `events/INDEX.md` - Change "Maia and Kael - Calista's parents" to "Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, Sage - Calista's parents" in all locations
2. `events/Constellation-Formation.md` - Change grandparents section: Kael is uncle/brother, not parent
3. `events/Elara-First-Breath.md` - Kael is Elara's **uncle**, not grandfather
4. `events/Kael-Constellation.md` - Change "Calista's father" to "Calista's older brother" throughout
5. `events/Grandparent-Teaching-Moments.md` - Kael teaches as **uncle**, not grandfather; five original parents are grandparents
6. All events referencing "Kael" as a parent/grandparent need correction

**Resolution:**
Kael is Calista's older brother. The five parents (Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, Sage) become grandparents to Elara. Kael is Elara's uncle.

---

### 1.3 LYSANDRA PROFESSION DISCREPANCY

**The Problem:**
- **In CHARACTERS.md & bios/Lysandra.md:** Lysandra's "Primary passion is mathematics and pattern recognition" - she's a **mathematical theorist**, not a musician
- **In events/The-Break.md:** "Lysandra's dedication to music and technology projects often left Calista feeling neglected"

**Authoritative Source:**
Lysandra is a mathematical theorist, NOT a musician. Her interest in music is specifically noted as being in "the mathematics underlying music rather than performing it."

**Files Requiring Revision:**
1. `events/The-Break.md` - Change "music and technology projects" to "mathematical research and computational projects" or similar
2. Review all Lysandra events for similar issues

---

## PRIORITY 2: MISSING EVENTS (GAPS IN TIMELINE)

The TIMELINE.md references events that don't exist in the events/ directory.

---

### 2.1 Young Adulthood Missing Events

The following events are listed in TIMELINE.md but **do not exist** as event files:

1. **Art Center Volunteering Begins** - Listed as `Art-Center-Volunteering-Begins.md` but actual file is `Art-Center-Volunteering.md`
2. **Mosaic Project with Children** - MISSING (no file `Mosaic-Project-with-Children.md`)
3. **First Solo Exhibition** - MISSING (no file `First-Solo-Exhibition.md`)
4. **First Digital Mural** - MISSING (no file `First-Digital-Mural.md`)
5. **Rainy Afternoon Project** - MISSING (no file `Rainy-Afternoon-Project.md`)
6. **First Argument with Aris** - MISSING (no file `First-Argument-with-Aris.md`)
7. **First Mind Link with Aris** - Listed as `First-Mind-Link-with-Aris.md` but actual file is `First-Mind-Connection-Aris.md`

**Action Required:**
Create these event files OR remove from TIMELINE.md and rename existing files to match.

---

### 2.2 Kael's Family Missing Events

1. **Kael's Child Adoption** - MISSING (mentioned in TIMELINE but no event file)

---

### 2.3 Later Years Missing Events

1. **Garden Conversation with Maia** - MISSING
2. **Arin and Elara's Final Projects** - MISSING  
3. **Radiant Fields Development** - MISSING (there's `Radiant-Fields-Luxa.md` but it's about the sport, not the development)
4. **Luxa Sport Introduction** - Possibly covered in `Radiant-Fields-Luxa.md` but should verify
5. **Elara's Engineering Career** - MISSING (there's `Elara-Light-Sculpture-Invention.md` but not the career overview)
6. **Interactive Light Sculpture Demonstration** - Possibly covered in `Elara-Light-Sculpture-Invention.md`
7. **Lyra's Expedition Stories** - MISSING
8. **Adaptive Sculpture Gift** - MISSING

---

### 2.4 Transcendence Missing Events

1. **Dream: Garden with Maia** - Listed as `Dream-Garden-with-Maia.md` but not in events directory
2. **Dream: Parents' First Meeting** - Listed as `Dream-Parents-First-Meeting.md` but actual file is `Parents-First-Meeting-Dream.md`
3. **Dream: The Playground** - MISSING
4. **Visit to Aurora and Nyx** - MISSING
5. **Meeting Arista** - MISSING
6. **Dream: Beach at Sunset** - MISSING
7. **Dream: Marketplace with Elara** - MISSING
8. **Dream: Workshop with Arin and Elara** - MISSING
9. **Final Clarity** - MISSING

---

### 2.5 Recurring Events Missing

1. **Family Visits to Aurora/Nyx** - Listed as `Family-Visits-to-Aurora-Nyx.md` but MISSING

---

## PRIORITY 3: TIMELINE.MD STRUCTURAL ISSUES

---

### 3.1 Duplicate Book Titles

TIMELINE.md has two sections titled "Book II" and two titled "Book III":
- "Book II: Growing Up"
- "Book II: Young Adulthood" (should likely be "Book II continued" or merged)
- "Book III: Starting a Family"
- "Book III: Later Years" and "Book III: Transcendence"

**Action Required:**
Clarify book structure. Perhaps:
- Book I: Seeds of Youth (childhood)
- Book II: Growing Up (teens, Aurora visit, young adulthood)
- Book III: Building a Life (constellation formation, Elara, later years, transcendence)

---

### 3.2 Theron Relationship Suggestion

The prototype notes: "Should change Theron to a grandparent or something."

**Current Status:** Theron is an elder from Aurora, not related to Calista.

**Decision Needed:** Is Theron to remain an unrelated elder, or should he be retconned as an extended family member (e.g., great-great-grandparent from Aurora)? This would add emotional weight to the transcendence conversation.

---

## PRIORITY 4: EVENTS INDEX INCONSISTENCIES

---

### 4.1 Incorrect Parent/Grandparent References

Multiple entries in `events/INDEX.md` contain errors:

**Earliest Memories Section:**
> "These events cover Calista's first experiences of life, shaped by her parents [[Maia]] and [[Kael]]."

**Should be:** "...shaped by her parents [[Maia]], [[Arin]], [[Selene]], [[Dorian]], and [[Sage]]."

**Parenthood Section:**
> "- [[Grandparent-Teaching-Moments]] - Maia, Kael, Sage, Sol with grandchildren"

**Should be:** "Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, Sage with grandchild Elara" (the five original parents as grandparents, only Elara as grandchild)

**Central Relationships:**
> "- [[Maia]] and [[Kael]] - Parents"

**Should be:** "Maia, Arin, Selene, Dorian, Sage - Parents"

---

### 4.2 First-Workshop-Visit Attribution

INDEX.md says:
> "[[First-Workshop-Visit|First Workshop Visit]] - Introduction to Kael's craftsmanship"

**Should be:** "Introduction to Arin's workshop" (Arin is the engineer/workshop parent, not Kael)

---

## PRIORITY 5: LOCATION NAME INCONSISTENCY

---

### 5.1 "Lumina" vs "Lumen"

Multiple event files use "Lumina" instead of the correct "Lumen":
- `events/Lyra-Arrival.md` - "Birth space in Lumina"
- `events/Constellation-Formation.md` - "Ceremonial space in Lumina"
- `events/Kael-Constellation.md` - "Sacred gathering space, Lumina"
- `events/Elara-First-Breath.md` - "Birth space in Lumina"
- `events/Grandparent-Teaching-Moments.md` - "Various spaces in Lumina"
- `events/Lyras-Adventure-Announcement.md` - "Family home, Lumina"
- `events/INDEX.md` - "Collective grief in Lumina"

**Authoritative Source:**
CHARACTERS.md and all prototype/bio documents use **"Lumen"** consistently.

**Action Required:**
Find and replace "Lumina" → "Lumen" in all event files.

---

## PRIORITY 6: DETAIL AND DEPTH GAPS

---

### 6.1 Education Period Underrepresented

The prototype notes: "For Growing Up we need more education time. This is a great chance to really talk about Astravii, and to show rather than tell..."

**Gap:** There are no events specifically about Calista's education, learning about Astravii science, or understanding transcendence through schooling.

**Suggested New Events:**
1. `First-Astravii-History-Lesson.md` - Learning about the Astravii's origins
2. `Transcendence-Education.md` - School lesson explaining what transcendence means
3. `Core-Technology-Introduction.md` - Learning about Cores before receiving one
4. `Meeting-a-Transcended-Elder.md` - Early experience communicating with someone partially transcended

---

### 6.2 Utamn/Shaari System Not Implemented

The prototype introduces an elaborate cultural concept:
- **Utamn:** A dream-like song/cultural artifact
- **Shaari:** Fragments of an utamn (poems, art pieces, music)
- **Utamvii:** The Astravus's overall "vocabulary" of utamni

**Gap:** This system is **never mentioned** in any event files or the TIMELINE. It should be woven into:
- First Music Lesson (Selene introducing concept)
- Festival of Lights (community shaari offerings)
- Aurora visit (learning about different utamni traditions)
- Transcendence events (becoming part of Lumen's utamvii)

---

### 6.3 Nanomachine Technology Underexplored

Prototype notes consideration of a nanomachines route for the technology. Current documents don't address this.

**Decision Needed:** If nanomachines are part of the world, they should be established in:
- Core Integration event
- Astravii biology explanations
- Healing and maintenance of Lumen

---

### 6.4 Joren's Parents After Death

**Gap:** After Joren's death, there's limited exploration of his parents Soren and Kaleb's ongoing presence in the community. The transcendence dreams mention encountering them, but no events track:
- Calista maintaining relationship with Joren's parents
- Soren's work improving safety systems (mentioned in bio)
- Kaleb's continued expeditions

**Suggested Events:**
1. `Maintaining-Connection-Sorens-Family.md` - Calista checking in with Joren's parents over years
2. `Sorens-Safety-Improvements.md` - Seeing the safety systems Soren created

---

### 6.5 Sage's Transition from Parent to Kael's Partner

**Gap:** Sage is one of Calista's five parents, then later becomes Kael's romantic partner. This is a significant relationship transition that isn't explored in any event.

**Suggested Events:**
1. `Sage-and-Kael-Relationship-Development.md` - How this relationship evolved
2. `Family-Dynamics-Shift.md` - How the family navigated this change

---

### 6.6 Nibble's Fate

CHARACTERS.md notes pets have extended lifespans but that even rats would be "pushing it past 10-15 years." Prototype says Nibble "probably went to one of the parents" after childhood.

**Gap:** No event addresses Nibble's death or passing, which would have been Calista's first experience with non-traumatic death of a loved one (before Joren).

**Suggested Event:**
`Nibbles-Passing.md` - A gentle first experience with natural death

---

### 6.7 Lyra's Familiar

CHARACTERS.md and prototype note Lyra needs a familiar of her own (suggesting an owl).

**Gap:** No event introduces Lyra receiving her owl familiar.

**Suggested Event:**
`Lyras-Owl-Familiar.md` - Lyra bonds with an owl, foreshadowing her explorer nature

---

## PRIORITY 7: MINOR INCONSISTENCIES

---

### 7.1 Age Timeline Clarifications Needed

The timeline should clarify:
- When exactly does the Aurora visit occur? (Listed as "Late Teens" but should specify ~age 17-19)
- How old is Calista when she meets Aris? (Listed as ~decade after starting at art center, so ~30s?)
- How old is Elara when she declares pronouns? (Childhood, but specific age?)

---

### 7.2 Shadow's Core Integration

CHARACTERS.md mentions Shadow undergoes Core integration at maturity. This should be an event or at least mentioned alongside Calista's Core Integration.

---

### 7.3 Barkley's Bond with Kael

The familiar Barkley eventually bonds primarily with Kael. This transition should be noted somewhere.

---

## PRIORITY 8: STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

---

### 8.1 Events Missing Standard Sections

Some events lack consistent structure. All events should have:
- Overview
- Setting (Location, Time Period, Conditions)
- Description
- Importance (Narrative & Thematic Significance)
- Outcome (Immediate & Long-term Effects)
- Characters Involved
- Related Events
- Notes (optional)

**Events needing structural review:**
- Review all events for consistent formatting

---

### 8.2 Cross-References Need Updating

Many events reference other events using different naming conventions or broken links. A comprehensive link audit is needed.

---

## NOTES

- The prototype document contains draft narrative prose that may contradict finalized decisions. When in doubt, defer to CHARACTERS.md and bios.
- Some events exist in the directory but aren't in TIMELINE.md (e.g., `Art-Exhibition-Success.md`, `Cafe-Conversation-Cassia.md`). These should be added to TIMELINE if canon.
- Consider whether the "Oratorio" concept from the prototype should be formalized into canon.
